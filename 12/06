We\nshow that the CDW is sensitive to both orbital and Pauli effects of the field.\nIn the case of perfect nesting, the critical temperature decreases monotonously\nwith the field, and the wave vector of the instability starts to shift above\nsome critical value of magnetic field. Depending on the ratio between the spin\nand charge coupling constants and on the direction of the applied magnetic\nfield, the wave vector shift is either parallel ($CDW_x$ order) or\nperpendicular ($CDW_y$ order) to the most conducting direction. The $CDW_x$\norder is a field dependent linear combination of the charge and spin density\nwaves and is sensible only to the Pauli effect. The wave vector shift in\n$CDW_y$ depends on the interchain coupling, but the critical temperature does\nnot. This order is affected by the confinement of the electronic orbits. By\nincreasing the relative strength of the orbital effect with respect to the\nPauli effect, one can destroy the $CDW_y$, establishing either a $CDW_x$, or a\n$CDW_0$ (corresponding to perfect nesting wave vector). We also show that by\nincreasing the imperfect nesting parameter, one passes from the regime where\nthe critical temperature decreases with the field to the regime where it is\ninitially enhanced by the orbital effect and eventually suppressed by the Pauli\neffect.
