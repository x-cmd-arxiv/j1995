As an example, the Population I kick velocity distribution\nof Lyne & Lorimer (1994) is used to estimate the retained fractions of neutron\nstars originating as single stars and in binary systems. For plausible initial\nconditions fewer than 4% of single neutron stars are retained. The retention\nfractions from binary systems can be 2 to 5 times higher. The dominant source\nof retained neutron stars is found to be through binary systems which remain\nbound after the first supernova, ie. high-mass X-ray binaries. The retained\nfraction decreases with an increasing number of progenitors, but the retention\nfraction decreases more slowly than the number of progenitors increases. On\nbalance, more progenitors give more neutron stars in the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 1995 17:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
