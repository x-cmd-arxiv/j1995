The original field solution is expressed in terms of usual Dirac\nspinors through a canonical transformation, whose generating function allows\nthe determination of the new Hamiltonian. It is emphasized that the original\nand transformed Hamiltonians are different because the mapping from the old to\nthe new canonical variables depends explicitly on time. The violation of\ncluster decomposition is discussed and the general Wightman functions\nsatisfying the positive-definiteness condition are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 1995 16:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

At\nfinite frequency, however, the interplay between rotation and vibrations\nproduces different effects depending on neutron number: The lowest octupole\nphonon is rotationally aligned in 190Hg, is crossed by the aligned\ntwo-quasiparticle bands in 192Hg, and retains the K=2 octupole vibrational\ncharacter up to the highest frequency in 194Hg.
