The basic process is the production\nof a quark-antiquark pair in the colour field of the proton. The structure\nfunctions are expressed in terms of Wilson lines along the classical\ntrajectories of quark and antiquark passing through the colour field, and their\ncovariant derivatives. Based on some rather general assumptions on properties\nof the colour field, inclusive and diffractive structure functions are\nevaluated in terms of four field dependent constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 1995 22:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}
