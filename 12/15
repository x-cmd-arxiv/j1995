The gaseous inflows are strongest when\ngalaxies with dense central bulges are in the final stages of merging, while\ninflows in bulgeless galaxies are weaker and occur earlier in the interaction.\nOrbital geometry plays only a relatively modest role in the onset of\ncollisionally-induced activity. Through an analysis of the torques acting on\nthe gas, we show that these inflows are generally driven by gravitational\ntorques from the host galaxy (rather than the companion), and that dense bulges\nact to stabilize galaxies against bar modes and inflow until the galaxies\nmerge, at which point rapidly varying gravitational torques drive strong\ndissipation and inflow of gas in the merging pair. The strongest inflows (and\nassociated starburst activity) develop in co-planar encounters, while the\nactivity in inclined mergers is somewhat less intense and occurs slightly later\nduring the merger. The starbursts which develop in mergers of galaxies with\ncentral bulges represent an increase in the star formation rate of two orders\nof magnitude over that in isolated galaxies. We find that the gaseous and\nstellar morphology and star-forming properties of these systems provide a good\nmatch to those of observed ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Our results imply\nthat the internal structure of the merging galaxies, rather than orbital\ngeometry, may be the key factor in producing ultraluminous infrared galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 1995 17:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

They have a clear and simple structure\ncorresponding to 1--loop vacuum graphs. Their continuum approximations are\nextracted by isolating the infrared singularities and it is shown that, in each\norder, they reduce to vacuum contributions for chiral fermions. In this sense\nthe lattice model is seen to constitute a valid regularization of the continuum\ntheory of chiral fermions coupled to weak and slowly varying gauge and Higgs\nfields. The overlap amplitude, while not gauge invariant, exhibits a well\ndefined (modulo phase conventions) response to gauge transformations of the\nbackground fields. This response reduces in the continuum limit to the expected\nchiral anomaly, independently of the phase conventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 1995 14:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
