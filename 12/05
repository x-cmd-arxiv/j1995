In these models the observed\noutput spectra consist entirely of photons reprocessed by the cloud, making it\ndifficult to extract information about the input spectra. Recently Miller\n(1995) has argued that the Fourier phase (or time) lag between hard and soft\nX-ray photons in actuality represents the phase lags intrinsic to the input\nsource, modulo a multiplicative factor. The phase lags thus would be a probe of\nthe input photon source. In this paper we examine this claim and find that,\nalthough true for the limited parameter space considered by Miller, the\nintrinsic phase lag disappears whenever the output photon energy is much\ngreater than the input photon energy. The remaining time lags represent a\n``shelf'' due to differences between mean diffusion times across the cloud. As\npointed out by Miller, the amplitude of this shelf -- which is present even\nwhen the intrinsic time lags remain -- is indicative of the size and\ntemperature of the Compton cloud and is a function of the two energies being\ncompared. However, we find that with previous instruments such as Ginga the\nshelf, if present, was likely obscured by counting noise. A more sensitive\nmeasure of Compton cloud parameters may be obtainable from the coherence\nfunction, which is derived from the amplitude of the Fourier cross power\nspectral density.

In contrast, we present an improved\ncalculation of an upper limit on the lightest higgs mass in supersymmetric\n(susy) models, by summing to all orders in perturbation theory the leading and\nnext--to--leading logarithms with a renormalization group equation technique,\nand by including finite two-loop QCD corrections.The improvement lowers the\nMinimal Susy Standard Model (MSSM) upper limit by about 10 GeV. The main\nuncertainty in each limit is the value of the top mass, which is now\nconstrained by the Fermilab results. We study the possibility that these bounds\ndo not overlap, and find that (i) a mass gap emerges between the SM and the\nMSSM at $m_t\\sim 175$ GeV for $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.118$ and at $m_t \\sim 180$ GeV\nfor more generous values $\\sim (0.130)$ of $\\alpha_s$; and between the SM and\nthe Minimal plus Singlet Susy Model [(M+1)SSM] if the independent scalar\nself--coupling of the latter is perturbatively small or if the $\\tan\\beta$\nparameter is large; these gaps widen with increasing $m_t$; (ii) the mass gap\nemerges with $m_t$ 10 GeV lighter if only vacuum stability and not\nmetastability is imposed; (iii) there is no overlap between the SM and the MSSM\nbounds at even smaller values of $m_t$ for the $\\tan\\beta$ value ($\\sim 1$--2)\npreferred in Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories. Thus, a measurement of the\nfirst higgs mass will serve to exclude either the MSSM/(M+1)SSM higgs sectors\nor the SM higgs sector. Finally, we comment on the discovery potential for the\nlightest higgses in these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 1995 02:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
