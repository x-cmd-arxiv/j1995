In addition, limits on $m_{W_R}$ valid for\nlarger values of the $N_R$ mass are obtained assuming that $N_R$ decays to an\nelectron and two jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 1995 19:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our approach is based on the\nrecently introduced scheme to quantize massless scalar fields coupled to 2D\ngravity maintaining invariance under area-preserving diffeomorphisms and Weyl\ntransformations. Starting from the CGHS model with the new effective action we\nreestablish the full diffeomorphism invariance by means of an adequate family\nof field redefinitions. The original theory is therefore mapped into a large\nfamily of solvable models. We focus our analysis on the one-parameter class of\nmodels interpolating between the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius model and the\nBose-Parker-Peleg model. Finally we shall briefly indicate how can we extend\nour approach to spherically symmetric Einstein gravity coupled to 2D conformal\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 1995 11:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
