We start with an\nantiferromagnetic mean-field description of the insulating state, and show that\ndoping creates solitons in the antiferromagnetic background. In one dimension,\nthe soliton is topological, spinless, and decoupled from the background\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations at low energies. In two dimensions and above,\nthe soliton is non-topological, has spin quantum number 1/2, and is strongly\ncoupled to the antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We derive the effective action\ngoverning the quasiparticle motion, study the properties of a single carrier,\nand comment on a possible description at finite concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 1995 21:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

A\nvariational electronic many-body wave function solves the dynamical problem.\nThe wave function consists of sectors with either zero or one particle-hole\npair and goes beyond earlier work through the inclusion of amplitudes for a\nneutral atom plus an electron-hole pair.
