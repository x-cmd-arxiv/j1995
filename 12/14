The including of very little advection has significant\neffects on two acoustic modes.

For systems\nin the ``Stochastic Region,'' where magnetization switching is on average\neffected by the nucleation and growth of fewer than two well-defined critical\ndroplets, the simulation results can be explained by the dynamics of a simple\nmodel in which the free energy is a function only of magnetization.
