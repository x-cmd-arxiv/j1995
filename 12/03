In addition, we tested the trial functions for a\nhypothetical, light atom resembling Ne but with only half its mass. We did not\nstudy atoms such as He with larger de Boer parameters, i.e., systems in which\nthe zero point energy plays a more important role relative to the potential\nenergy. This is the main purpose of the present paper. In fact, we study\nclusters to the very limit where the zero-point energy destroys the ground\nstate as a bound state. A simple picture of this un-binding transition predicts\nthe power law with which the energy vanishes as the de Boer parameter\napproaches its critical value and the power of the divergence of the the size\nof the clusters in this limit. Our numerical results are in agreement with\nthese predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 1995 22:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
