This is achieved through a simple local\nrelation between the convergence and the observables, which can be applied\ngenerally over the surface a cluster. In the weak lensing limit, the\nconvergence reduces to a dependence on the magnification alone, so that in the\noutskirts of clusters the surface-density of matter is obtained directly from\nthe surface-density of background galaxies.

The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique\nto compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under\nimplication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate\nfor learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is\nthe basic program structure of logic programs.

Calculations were done in a local density\napproximation using two different spectral functions for nuclear matter.\nResults are compared to those obtained for a spectral function which has been\nevaluated directly for the finite nucleus, ^{16}O, under consideration. For\nvalues of x around 1.5 and larger the quasiparticle contribution is negligible,\nthus stressing the sensitivity of the present reaction to the dynamical\nproperties of nuclei beyond the shell model approach. Several approximations\nwhich are usually employed in studies of the EMC effect have been analyzed and\ntheir inaccuracy in this region is demonstrated. The results stress the fact\nthat the nuclear structure function contains important information on nuclear\ndynamical correlations. Therefore further measurements of F_2A(x) in that\nregion and for many nuclei would be most welcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 1995 18:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 1995 08:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 1996 12:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}
