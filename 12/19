Under certain conditions, this Li-7\ncreation can take the place of the Li-7 destruction normally expected. Note\nthat such extra mixing on the red giant branch (RGB) has previously been\ninvoked to explain the observed C-13 enhancements. This new Li-7 production can\naccount for the recent discovery of surprisingly high lithium abundances in\nsome low mass red giants (a few of which are super-rich lithium stars, with\nabundances higher than that in the interstellar medium). The amount of Li-7\nproduced can exceed log epsilon(Li-7) = 4, but depends critically on the\ndetails of the extra mixing mechanism (mixing speeds, geometry, episodicity).\nIf the deep circulation is a relatively long-lived, continuous process,\nlithium-rich RGB stars should be completely devoid of beryllium and boron.

The overall contribution from solar-metallicity stars (1 - 40\nMsun) is expected to be net destruction of He-3, with overall He-3 survival\nfraction g_3 = 0.9 +/- 0.2 (weighted average) --- in contrast to standard\ndredge-up, which would predict stars are net producers of He-3 (g_3:dr = 2.4\n+/- 0.5).
