For inflation, we develop a perturbative analysis\nfor the study of spatial correlations in the inflaton in the context of the\nstochastic approach to inflation.

We also devote a part of\nthe thesis to the study of recently proposed analytic models of topological\ndefects, and implement them in the analysis of both the CMB excess kurtosis\n(for cosmic strings) and the CMB collapsed 3-point function and skewness (for\ntextures).

On the one hand, agreement between\nexperiments and the Standard Model (SM) has improved for the line-shape and the\nasymmetry data. The $\\tau$ widths and asymmetries are now consistent with\n$e$--$\\mu$--$\\tau$ universality, and all the asymmetry data including the\nleft-right asymmetry from SLC are consistent with the SM (16\\%CL). On the other\nhand, a discrepancy between experiments and SM predictions is sharpened for two\nobservables, $R_b$ and $R_c$, where $R_q$ is the partial $Z$ boson width ratio\n$\\Gamma_q/\\Gamma_h$. $R_b$ is 3\\% larger (3.7$\\sigma$) and $R_c$ is 11\\%\nsmaller (2.5$\\sigma$) than the SM predictions.
