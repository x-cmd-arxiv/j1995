It is shown that these\n\"supermodular\" transformations depend on the spinor structure of the\nsupermanifold by terms proportional to the odd modular parameters. The above\nterms are calculated in the explicit form. They are urgent for the divergency\nproblem in the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz superstring theory and for calculating the\nfundamental domain in the modular space. The supermodular transformations of\nthe multi-loop superstring partition functions calculated by the solution of\nthe Ward identities are studied. The above Ward identities are shown to be\ncovariant under the supermodular transformations. So the partition functions\nnecessarily possess the covariance under the transformations discussed. It is\ndemonstrated explicitly the covariance of the above partition functions at zero\nodd moduli under those supermodular transformations, which turn a pair of even\ngenus-1 spinor structures to a pair of the odd genus-1 spinor ones. The brief\nconsideration of the cancellation of divergences is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 1995 13:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
