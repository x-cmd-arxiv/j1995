Using this\nsample and the {\\em ROSAT} PSPC X--ray image of the cluster, we have\nre-analyzed the structure and kinematics of Coma, by applying the wavelet and\nadaptive kernel techniques. A striking coincidence of features is found in the\ndistributions of galaxies and hot intracluster gas. The two central dominant\ngalaxies, NGC4874 and NGC4889, are surrounded by two galaxy groups, mostly\npopulated with galaxies brighter than b$_{26.5}=17$ and well separated in\nvelocity space. On the contrary, the fainter galaxies tend to form a single\nsmooth structure with a central peak coinciding in position with a secondary\npeak detected in X--rays, and located between the two dominant galaxies; we\nsuggest to identify this structure with the main body of the Coma cluster. A\ncontinuous velocity gradient is found in the central distribution of these\nfaint galaxies, a probable signature of tidal interactions rather than\nrotation. There is evidence for a bound population of bright galaxies around\nother brightest cluster members. Altogether, the Coma cluster structure seems\nto be better traced by the faint galaxy population, the bright galaxies being\nlocated in subclusters. We discuss this evidence in terms of an ongoing\naccretion of groups onto the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 1995 08:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
