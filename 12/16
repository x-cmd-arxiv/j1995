Then, its debris may form a precessing stream which may even\ncollide with itself. In order to understand the dynamical effects of the\nstream-stream collision on the eventual accretion of the stellar debris onto\nthe black hole, we have studied how gas flow behaves when the outgoing stream\ncollides supersonically with the incoming stream. We have investigated the\nproblem analytically with one-dimensional plane-parallel streams and\nnumerically with more realistic three-dimensional streams. A shock formed\naround the contact surface converts the bulk of the orbital streaming kinetic\nenergy into thermal energy. In three-dimensional simulations, the accumulated\nhot post-shock gas then expands adiabatically and drives another shock into the\nlow density ambient region. Through this expansion, thermal energy is converted\nback to the kinetic energy associated with the expanding motion. Thus, in the\nend, only a small fraction of the orbital kinetic energy is actually converted\nto the thermal energy, while most of it is transferred to the kinetic energy of\nthe expanding gas. Nevertheless the collision is effective in circularizing the\ndebris orbit, because the shock efficiently transforms the ordered motion of\nthe streams into the expanding motion in directions perpendicular to the\nstreams. The circularization efficiency decreases, if two colliding streams\nhave a large ratio of cross sections and a large density contrast. But even in\nsuch cases, the main shock extends beyond the overlapping contact surface and\nthe high pressure region behind the shock keeps the stream of the larger cross\nsection from passing freely. Thus the stream-stream collisions are still\nexpected to circularize the stellar debris rather efficiently, unless the ratio\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 1995 22:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

For both WL16 and 1548C27, we interpret our modeling results as\nindicating that the overtone emission arises from a temperature inversion\nregion in the inner disk atmosphere.

The monopole solutions of\nthe theory transform under the non-abelian part of the unbroken global symmetry\nand the associated component of the moduli space is a Lie group coset space.\nThe well-known problems in introducing collective coordinates for these\ndegrees-of-freedom are solved by considering suitable multi-monopole\nconfigurations in which the long-range non-abelian fields cancel. In the\ncontext of an $N=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory, the multiplicity of BPS\nsaturated states is given by the number of ground-states of a supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics on the compact internal moduli space. The resulting\ndegeneracy is expressed as the Euler character of the coset space. In all cases\nthe number of states is consistent with the dimensions of the multiplets of the\nunbroken dual gauge group, and hence the results provide strong support for the\nGNO conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 1995 17:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 1996 15:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Our chiral perturbation calculation indicates that\nthe pion rescattering term should be significantly enhanced as compared with\nthe traditional phenomenological treatment, and that this term should have\nsubstantial energy and momentum dependence. An important consequence of this\nenergy-momentum dependence is that, for a representative threshold kinematics\nand within the framework of our semiquantitative calculation, the rescattering\nterm interferes destructively with the Born-term in sharp contrast to the\nconstructive interference obtained in the conventional treatment.
