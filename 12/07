This result extends the previously known results for the simplest\ncases of $N=1$ and $N=2$ to arbitrary $N$. It is shown that $SH_N(\\nu)$ admits\n$q(N)$ independent supertraces where $q(N)$ is a number of partitions of $N$\ninto a sum of odd positive integers, so that $q(N)>1$ for $N\\ge 3$. Some\nconsequences of the existence of several independent supertraces of $SH_N (\\nu\n)$ are discussed such as the existence of ideals in associated $W_{\\infty}$ -\ntype Lie superalgebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 1995 16:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The concept of a string\nbackground has been extended to the notion of $W$-strings, where the BRST\nsymmetry is still largely conjectural. More recently, the BRST formalism has\nentered the construction of two dimensional topological conformal quantum field\ntheories, such as those that arise from Calabi-Yau varieties. In this lecture,\nwe focus on common features of the BRST cohomology algebras of string\nbackgrounds and topological field theories.
