More generally, to any\ngeneralized Cartan matrix A and a point q in a 1-dimensional complex algebraic\ngroup \\c we associate an associative algebra H. If A is of finite type and\n\\c=C^*, the algebra H is the affine Hecke algebra of the corresponding finite\nroot system.

The purpose is twofold: to distinguish\ncompact cluster structures from diffusion limited aggregates, and to find\nobservable {\\em signatures} that can characterize the compact clusters at the\natomic level of detail. To simplify the collision dynamics, the study is\ncarried out in the framework of the sudden approximation, which assumes that\nmomentum changes perpendicular to the surface are large compared with momentum\ntransfer due to surface corrugation. The diffusion limited aggregates on which\nthe scattering calculations were done, were generated by kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations. It is demonstrated, by focusing on the example of compact Pt\nHeptamers, that signatures of structure of compact clusters may indeed be\nextracted from the scattering distribution. These signatures enable both an\nexperimental distinction between diffusion limited aggregates and compact\nclusters, and a determination of the cluster structure. The characteristics\ncomprising the signatures are, to varying degrees, the Rainbow, Fraunhofer,\nspecular and constructive interference peaks, all seen in the intensity\ndistribution. It is also shown, how the distribution of adsorbate heights above\nthe metal surface can be obtained by an analysis of the specular peak\nattenuation. The results contribute to establishing He scattering as a powerful\ntool in the investigation of surface disorder and epitaxial growth on surfaces,\nalongside with STM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 1995 14:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
