Such a model accounts well for the ``normal\"\nSN~Ia and for the observed dispersion exemplified by the light curve\namplitude-shape relation. The criterion that the white dwarfs involved in this\nprocess grow to nearly 1.4 Msun continues to provide a great challenge to\nunderstanding the binary stellar evolution involved. The so-called ``supersoft\nX-ray sources\" may provide an important new population of SN~Ia progenitors.\nOther techniques are being developed that may constrain the binary evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 1995 23:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The reasons\nfor doing this are twofold, first to explain the deviations from the standard\nmodel observed in $R_b$ and $R_c$ and second to constrain non-standard\ncontributions to couplings of the $Z^0$ boson to all fermions and to the\noblique parameters. We do so by comparing the data with the Standard Model as\nwell as with a number of test hypotheses concerning the nature of the new\nphysics. These include non-standard $Zb\\bar{b}$-, $Zc\\bar{c}$- and\n$Zs\\bar{s}$-couplings as well as the couplings of the $Z^0$ to fermions of the\nentire first, second and third generations and universal corrections to all up-\nand down-type quark couplings (as can arise \\eg\\ in $Z'$ mixing models). We\nfind that non-standard $Zb\\bar{b}$ couplings are both necessary and sufficient\nto explain the data and in particular the $R_b$ anomaly. It is not possible to\nexplain $R_b$, $R_c$ and a value of the strong coupling constant consistent\nwith low energy determinations invoking only non-standard $Zb\\bar{b}$- and\n$Zc\\bar{c}$-couplings.
