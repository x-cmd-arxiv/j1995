In the {\\em high state}, in which 2 -- 10 keV\nluminosity is relatively high, the energy index of the hard X-ray emission is\nusually greater than 1 --- typically $\\sim 1.5$. On the other hand, in the {\\em\nlow state}, the hard X-ray energy index is 0.3 -- 0.9. In this paper, we\nsuggest that this difference of the hard X-ray spectral slopes may be due to\ntwo different Comptonization mechanisms. We propose that, in the high state,\nthe hard component is governed by the Comptonization due to the bulk motion of\nthe almost freely falling (convergent accretion) flow close to the black hole,\nrather than thermal Comptonization. The spectral slope of the hard component is\ninsensitive to the disk accretion rate governing the soft component, hence is\nnearly invariant in spite of the soft component variations. The power-law\ncomponent due to the bulk motion Comptonization has a sharp cut-off at around\nthe electron rest mass energy, which is consistent with high energy\nobservations of the high state. In the low state, the spectrum is formed due to\nthermal Comptonization of the low-frequency disk radiation by a sub-Keplerian\ncomponent (possibly undergoing a centrifugally-supported shock) which is\noriginated from the Keplerian disk. In the limit of low disk accretion rate,\nthe power law index is uniquely determined by the mass accretion rate of the\nsub-Keplerian component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 1995 16:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The absence of such large\nsplittings has been used as a test of cosmological models: the standard Cold\nDark Matter model has been excluded on the basis that it predicts far too many\nlarge--separation double images. These studies assume that the lensing\nstructure has the mass profile of a singular isothermal sphere. However, such\nlarge splittings would be produced by very massive systems such as clusters of\ngalaxies, for which other gravitational lensing data suggest less singular mass\nprofiles. Here we analyze two cases of mass profiles for lenses: an isothermal\nsphere with a finite core radius (density $\\rho \\propto\n(r^2+r_{core}^2)^{-1})$, and a Hernquist profile ($\\rho \\propto\nr^{-1}(r+a)^{-3}$). We find that small core radii $r_{core} \\sim 30 h^{-1}$\nkpc, as suggested by the cluster data, or large $a \\gsim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc, as\nneeded for compatibility with gravitational distortion data, would reduce the\nnumber of large--angle splittings by an order of magnitude or more. Thus, it\nappears that these tests are sensitive both to the cosmological model (number\ndensity of lenses) and to the inner lens structure, which is unlikely to depend\nsensitively on the cosmology, making it difficult to test the cosmological\nmodels by large--separation quasar lensing until we reliably know the structure\nof the lenses themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 1995 17:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
