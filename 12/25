Long and short bursts also differ\nqualitatively in their spectral behavior, with short bursts harder in the BATSE\n(50--300 KeV) band, but long bursts more likely to be detected at photon\nenergies > 1 MeV. This implies different spatial origin and physical processes\nfor long and short bursts. Long bursts may be explained by accretion-induced\ncollapse. Short bursts require another mechanism, for which we suggest neutron\nstar collisions. These are capable of producing neutrino bursts as short as a\nfew ms, consistent with the shortest observed time scales in GRB. We briefly\ninvestigate the parameters of clusters in which neutron star collisons may\noccur, and discuss the nuclear evolution of expelled and accelerated matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 1995 10:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
