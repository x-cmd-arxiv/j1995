Modifications of this distribution caused by\ngravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapse\napproximation. We test this model against results from a variety of N-body\nsimulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function.\nThis bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between\ndark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation\nresults and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the\nvariance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensity\nis significantly smaller than the Poisson value.

Although the\nother metals in column IIB have an $hcp$ ground state, mercury's ground state\nis the body centered tetragonal $\\beta$Hg phase. The most common phase of\nmercury is the rhombohedral $\\alpha$Hg phase, which is stable from 79K to the\nmelting point and meta-stable below 79K. Another rhombohedral phase,\n$\\gamma$Hg, is believed to exist at low temperatures. First-principles\ncalculations are used to study the energetics of the various phases of mercury.\nEven when partial spin-orbit effects are included, the calculations indicate\nthat the hexagonal close packed structure is the ground state. It is suggested\nthat a better treatment of the spin-orbit interaction might alter this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 1995 17:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

A survey of textbooks on quantum mechanics by authors such as Dicke\nand Witke (1960), Eisberg and Resnick (1985), Gasiorowicz (1974), Goswami\n(1992), and Liboff (1993) supports this point. Furthermore, in line with the\nview of Bohr and Feynman, generally the unavoidable interaction between a\nmeasuring instrument and the physical entity measured is considered responsible\nfor the uncertainty principle. A gedankenexperiment using Feynman's double-hole\ninterference scenario shows that physical interaction is not necessary to\neffect the change in the wave function that occurs in measurement in quantum\nmechanics. Instead, the general case is that knowledge is linked to the change\nin the wave function, not a physical interaction between the physical existent\nmeasured and the measuring instrument. Empirical work on electron shelving that\ninvolves null measurements, or what Renninger called negative observations\n(Zeitschrift fur Physik, vol. 158, p. 417), supports these points.
