The sample includes various earlier\nmagnitude-limited surveys constructed by our team as well as a new survey of\n1026 redshifts measured for galaxies at intermediate magnitudes. The large\nrange in apparent magnitude sampled allows us to investigate both the nature of\nthe LF at low redshift (z<0.1) and possible evolution in its shape to z=0.75.\nWe find that earlier bright surveys have underestimated the absolute\nnormalisation of the LF. Because the shape of the local LF does not change with\nthe survey apparent magnitude limit, it seems unlikely that the local\ndeficiency arises from an underestimated population of low luminosity galaxies.\nFurthermore, surface brightness losses cannot be significant unless they\nconspire to retain the LF shape over a variety of detection thresholds. Our\ndata directly demonstrates that the B-band LF evolves with redshift. This\nevolution is best represented as a steepening of the faint-end slope of the LF,\nfrom alpha=-1.1 at low redshift to alpha=-1.5 at z=0.5. Using [OII] emission as\nan indicator of star formation activity, we show that the LF of quiescent\ngalaxies has remained largely unchanged since z=0.5, whereas the luminosity\ndensity of star-forming galaxies has declined by nearly a factor of 2. The\nsteepening of the overall LF with lookback time is a direct consequence of the\nincreasing space density of blue star-forming galaxies at moderate redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 1995 05:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 1995 22:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 1995 08:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In\nparticular, we show under this assumption that the number of preperiodic points\nis at most~$9$. Elliptic curves of small conductor and the genus~$2$ modular\ncurves $X_1(13)$, $X_1(16)$, and $X_1(18)$ all arise as curves classifying\nquadratic polynomials with various combinations of preperiodic points. To\ncomplete the classification, we compute the rational points on a non-modular\ngenus~$2$ curve by performing a $2$-descent on its Jacobian and afterwards\napplying a variant of the method of Chabauty and Coleman.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

To test this so-called quantum Zeno effect\nan experiment was performed by Itano et al. (Phys. Rev. A 41, 2295 (1990)) in\nwhich an atomic-level measurement was realized by means of a short laser pulse.\nThe relevance of the results has given rise to controversies in the literature.\nIn particular the projection postulate and its applicability in this experiment\nhave been cast into doubt. In this paper we show analytically that for a wide\nrange of parameters such a short laser pulse acts as an effective level\nmeasurement to which the usual projection postulate applies with high accuracy.\nThe corrections to the ideal reductions and their accumulation over n pulses\nare calculated. Our conclusion is that the projection postulate is an excellent\npragmatic tool for a quick and simple understanding of the slow-down of time\nevolution in experiments of this type. However, corrections have to be\nincluded, and an actual freezing does not seem possible because of the finite\nduration of measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 1995 14:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
