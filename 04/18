These components have been imaged through an R filter in\norder to obtain their light curves. The photometry was obtained by\nsimultaneously fitting a stellar two-dimensional profile on each component. The\nbrightest image (component A, m(R) = 15.7) shows a slow and smooth increase in\nbrightness of 0.2 magnitude in seven years, while the faintest one (component\nB, m(R) = 20.1) displays an outburst of 0.4 magnitude which lasts approximately\ntwo years. The variation of component B may be interpreted in two ways,\nassuming UM 425 is gravitationally lensed. If it is due to an intrinsic\nvariation of the quasar, we derive a lower limit of 3 years on the time delay\nfrom the fact that it is not observed in component A. On the other hand, if it\nis a microlensing ``High Amplification Event'', we estimate the size of the\nsource to be ~ 10^{-3} pc, in agreement with standard models of AGNs.

The bifurcation behaviour\nof the states is analysed using different order parameters such as flow\nintensity, Nusselt number, a newly defined mixing parameter characterized by\nthe variance of the concentration field, and the TW frequency. For further\ncomparison with experiments, light intensity distributions are determined that\ncan be observed in side-view shadowgraphs. Structural analyses of all fields\nare made using colour coded isoplots, vertical and lateral field profiles, and\nlateral Fourier decompositions. Transport properties of TWs are also discussed,\nin particular the mean lateral concentration current that is caused by the\nphase difference between concentration wave and velocity wave and that is\nroughly proportional to the TW frequency.
