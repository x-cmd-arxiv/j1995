The method is\nbased on gravitational lensing and makes use of the following: (1) the\namplitude of lensing-induced distortions of background galaxies increases with\nredshift; (2) the surface brightnesses of galaxies decrease steeply with\nredshift. The distortions of galaxy images due to lensing are thus expected to\nbe inversely correlated with surface brightness, allowing us to obtain relative\ndistances to galaxies as a function of surface brightness. If the redshifts of\nthe brightest galaxies are measured, then the relative distance scale can be\nconverted to mean galaxy redshifts as a function of surface brightness.\nFurther, by comparing the angular sizes of lensed galaxies with those of\nsimilar galaxies in empty control fields, it is possible to break the so-called\nmass sheet degeneracy inherent to cluster mass reconstruction techniques which\nare based purely on image ellipticities. This allows an unambiguous\ndetermination of the surface density of a lensing cluster.

According\nto recent data from the H1 and ZEUS experiments, the gluon density in a proton\nrises steeply as $x$ tends to zero. So nuclei which in the infinite momentum\nframe have a large surface density of gluons model at larger $x$ values what we\nexpect for the proton at much smaller $x$. Using experimental information on\nnuclear shadowing we predict the unitarity corrections to the proton structure\nfunction at small $x$ and extract the bare Pomeron intercept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 1995 17:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, we prove that any local system\nof $\\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted vertex operators on $M$ has a vertex superalgebra\nstructure with an automorphism $\\sigma$ of order $T$ with $M$ as a\n$\\sigma$-twisted module. Then we prove that for a vertex (operator)\nsuperalgebra $V$ with an automorphism $\\sigma$ of order $T$, giving a\n$\\sigma$-twisted $V$-module $M$ is equivalent to giving a vertex (operator)\nsuperalgebra homomorphism from $V$ to some local system of\n$\\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted vertex operators on $M$. As applications, we study the\ntwisted modules for vertex operator (super)algebras associated to some\nwell-known infinite-dimensional Lie (super)algebras and we prove the complete\nreducibility of $\\Bbb{Z}_{T}$-twisted modules for vertex operator algebras\nassociated to standard modules for an affine Lie algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 1995 05:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
