The gasdynamical simulations in a disk perturbed by spiral or bar\npotential are incorporated into the kinematic calculations of induction\nequations to elucidate the effects of non-axisymmetric disk structure on\nmagnetic fields. The effects of interstellar turbulence are given as the\nturbulent diffusion of magnetic fields. The usually adopted dynamo mechanism of\nalpha-effect is not considered in our computations, because it is not obvious\nabout the actual existence of the effect in a galaxy. Our principal concern is\nto clear how observationally and theoretically well-established gas flow\naffects the magnetic-field structure and evolution, without putting a lot of\nartificial parameters in the model. We have found that the density-wave\nstreaming motion of gas has a significant influence on the distribution of\nmagnetic fields: the lines of force are well aligned with spiral arms due to\nthe compressional and additional shearing flow of gas in these regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 1995 10:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
