In contrast to earlier studies\nwhich use time stepping to find the steady solutions, the steady state\nequations are first solved directly to obtain the multiple equilibria under\nidentical mixed boundary conditions. This approach is based on the\ndifferentiability of the governing equations and especially the convection\nscheme. A linear stability analysis is then performed, in which the normal\nmodes and corresponding eigenvalues are found for the various equilibrium\nstates. Resonant periodic solutions superimposed on these states are predicted\nfor various types of forcing. The results are used to gain insight into the\nsolutions obtained by Mysak, Stocker and Huang in a previous numerical study in\nwhich the eddy diffusivities were varied in a randomly forced one-basin zonally\naveraged model.

It is shown that the relation between the two BRST charges is a\nreflection of the fact that they can be interpreted geometrically as\nexpressions for the exterior derivative on G relative to two different bases,\nand an explicit expression for the generator of the similarity transformation\nis obtained. This result is applied in an infinite-dimensional setting, where\nit yields the similarity transformation used by Ishikawa and Kato to prove the\nequivalence of the Berkovits-Vafa superstring with the underlying bosonic\nstring theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 1995 04:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
