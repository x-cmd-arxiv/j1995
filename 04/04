Yet\nS-matrix theory cannot treat unstable particles as external states. Dealing\nwith complete matrix elements involving their decay products complicates\ncalculations considerably and is unnecessary in many practical situations. It\nis shown how to construct physically meaningful production cross-sections for\nunstable particles by extracting that part of the matrix element that\ncorresponds to finite-range space-time propagation. This procedure avoids the\nneed to define unstable particles in external states and we argue its favour as\nproviding a solution to a long-standing problem in physics. As an example the\nresults are applied to the calculation of the cross-section $\\sigma(e^+e^-\\to\nZ^0Z^0)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 1995 15:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 1995 16:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 1997 15:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
