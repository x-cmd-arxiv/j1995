The calculation is purely Lagrangian and\nit is derived using the second-order solutions of the Lagrange-Newton system\nobtained by Buchert & Ehlers. The procedure is applied to two particular\nsolutions given generic initial conditions. In this approach, the continuity\nequation yields a relation between the over-density and peculiar-velocity\nfields that automatically satisfies Euler's equation because the orbits are\nderived from the Lagrange-Newton system. This scheme generalizes some results\nobtained by Nusser et al. (1991) in the context of the Zel'dovich\napproximation. As opposed to several other reconstruction schemes, in this\napproach it is not necessary to truncate the expansion of the Jacobian given by\nthe continuity equation in order to calculate a first- or second-order\nexpression for the density field. In these previous schemes, the density\ncontrast given by (a) the continuity equation and (b) Euler's equation are\nmutually incompatible. This inconsistency arises as a consequence of an\nimproper handling of Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates in the analysis. Here,\nwe take into account the fact that an exact calculation of the density is\nfeasible in the Lagrangian picture and therefore an accurate and consistent\ndescription is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 1995 18:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 1995 12:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 1997 14:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 1997 13:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

It is shown that if one wants to account for\nthe natural language expressiveness, one should distinguish between pragmatic\ninferences that are felicitous to defeat and pragmatic inferences that are\ninfelicitously defeasible. Thus, it is shown that one should consider at least\nthree types of information: indefeasible, felicitously defeasible, and\ninfelicitously defeasible.
