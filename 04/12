A possible explanation has been proposed recently\n[Malhotra, R., {\\it Nature} 365:819-21 (1993)] which suggests that these\nextraordinary orbital properties may be a natural consequence of the formation\nand early dynamical evolution of the outer Solar system. A resonance capture\nmechanism is possible during the clearing of the residual planetesimal debris\nand the formation of the Oort Cloud of comets by planetesimal mass loss from\nthe vicinity of the giant planets. If this mechanism were in operation during\nthe early history of the planetary system, the entire region between the orbit\nof Neptune and approximately 50 AU would have been swept by first order mean\nmotion resonances. Thus, resonance capture could occur not only for Pluto, but\nquite generally for other trans-Neptunian small bodies. Some consequences of\nthis evolution for the present-day dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian\nregion are: (i) most of the objects in the region beyond Neptune and up to\n$\\sim\\!50$ AU exist in very narrow zones located at orbital resonances with\nNeptune (particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1 resonances), and (ii) these resonant\nobjects would have significantly large eccentricities.

It is shown that ultraviolet divergences in the\ndiagrammatic expansion translate into anomalous scaling with the inner length\nacting as the renormalization scale. In this paper we compute analytically the\ninfinite set of anomalous exponents that stem from the ultraviolet divergences.\nNotwithstanding, non-perturbative effects furnish a possibility of anomalous\nscaling based on the outer renormalization scale.

The conspicuous values assumed by many physical\nconstants (e.g., the vanishing effective cosmological constant, the smallness\nof the Higgs mass compared to the Planck scale, the finestructure constants,\n$\\Theta_{QCD}$) seem to coincide with values that are obtained if one assumes\nthat Nature in general seeks out multiple point values for intensive\nparameters. Multiple point values would occur in the presence of many\ncoexisting phases. Such coexistence could be enforced by having fixed but not\nfinetuned amounts of extensive quantities. We show that universally fixed\namounts of extensive quantities is tantamount to having long range nonlocal\ninteractions of a special type: these interactions are identical between fields\nat all pairs of spacetime points regardless of the spacetime distance between\nthem. Such omnipresent nonlocal interactions, which can be described by a very\ngeneral form of a reparameterization invariant action, would not be perceived\nas ``action at a distance'' but rather most likely incorporated into our theory\nas constants of Nature. Hence one can speculate that this mild form of\nnonlocality is the underlying explanation of Nature's affinity for the multiple\npoint.

The broadcast diameter of a network is the maximum time required for\na message originating at a node of the network to be relayed to all other\nnodes, under the restriction that in a single time step any node can\ncommunicate with only one neighboring node. For many parameter values these\nalgebraic methods yield the largest known constructions, improving on previous\ngraph-theoretic approaches. It has previously been shown that hypercubes are\noptimal for degree $k$ and broadcast diameter $k$. A construction employing\ndihedral groups is shown to be optimal for degree $k$ and broadcast diameter\n$k+1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
