If gamma-ray bursts are cosmological, the\nenergy dependence of gamma-ray burst time scales must be understood in order to\ncorrect the time scale dependence due to the expansion of the universe. By\nusing the average autocorrelation function and the average pulse width, we show\nthat the narrowing with energy follows, quite well, a power law. The power law\nindex is about -0.4. This is the first quantitative relationship between\ntemporal and spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts. It is unclear what physics\ncauses this relationship. The average autocorrelation has a universal shape\nsuch that one energy range scales linearly with time into all other energy\nranges.
