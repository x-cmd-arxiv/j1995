In the temperature range explored the quantum\nflux state depends only on the parabolic approximation of the anharmonic\nbarrier potential near the top. The parameter range within which the solution\nis valid is investigated in detail. In particular, by matching the flux state\nonto the equilibrium state on one side of the barrier we gain a condition on\nthe minimal damping strength. For very high temperatures this condition reduces\nto a known result from classical rate theory. Within the specified parameter\nrange the decay rate out of a metastable state is calculated from the flux\nsolution. The rate is shown to coincide with the result of purely thermodynamic\nmethods. The real time approach presented can be extended to lower temperatures\nand smaller damping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 1995 16:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
