As an illustration of this\nmethod, we give one approach to the construction of linear representations of\nbraid group and derive some series of such representations. Some invariants of\noriented knots and links are constructed.\n  The author is grateful to Yuri Drozd, Sergey Ovsienko and other members of\nalgebraic seminar at Kiev University for the creative atmosphere without which\nthis work could hardly appear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 1995 16:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Using this formulation we\ngive a construction of simple current from a primary semisimple element of\nweight one. We then prove that if a rational vertex operator algebra $V$ has a\nsimple current $M$ satisfying certain conditions, then $V\\oplus M$ has a\nnatural rational vertex operator (super)algebra structure. Applying our results\nto a vertex operator algebra associated to an affine Lie algebra, we construct\nits simple currents and the extension by a simple current. We also present two\nessentially equivalent constructions for twisted modules for an inner\nautomorphism from the adjoint module or any untwisted module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 1995 04:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
