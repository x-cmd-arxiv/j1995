We follow both dark\nmatter and baryonic gas which is subject to thermal pressure, shocks and\nradiative cooling. Galaxy formation is identified with the dissipative collapse\nof the gas into cold, compact knots. We examine two extreme representations of\ngalaxies during subsequent cluster evolution --- one purely gaseous and the\nother purely stellar. The results are quite sensitive to this choice.\nGas-galaxies merge efficiently with a dominant central object while\nstar-galaxies merge less frequently. Thus, simulations in which galaxies remain\ngaseous appear to suffer an ``overmerging'' problem, but this problem is much\nless severe if the gas is allowed to turn into stars. We compare the kinematics\nof the galaxy population in these two representations to that of dark halos and\nof the underlying dark matter distribution. Galaxies in the stellar\nrepresentation are positively biased (\\ie over-represented in the cluster) both\nby number and by mass fraction. Both representations predict the galaxies to be\nmore centrally concentrated than the dark matter, whereas the dark halo\npopulation is more extended. A modest velocity bias also exists in both\nrepresentations, with the largest effect, $\\sigma_{gal}/\\sigma_{DM} \\simeq\n0.7$, found for the more massive star-galaxies. Phase diagrams show that the\ngalaxy population has a substantial net inflow in the gas representation, while\nin the stellar case it is roughly in hydrostatic equilibrium. Virial mass\nestimators can underestimate the true cluster mass by up to a factor of 5.

For small\nparticle numbers at a low temperature, we find that though the grandcanonical\npartition function in SPA+RPA approach is quite close to its exact value, the\nsmall errors in its estimation causes significant suppression of level density\nobtained using number projected partition function. The results are also\ncompared with the smoothed out exact values of level density. Within this model\nstudy, it appears that due to saddle point approximation to multiple\nLaplace-back transform, the grandcanonical treatment of level density at low\ntemperature may be reliable only for relatively large number of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 1995 14:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 1995 19:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
