We show that the soft terms align with the quark\nand lepton Yukawa couplings, just as spins align with an external magnetic\nfield. As a result, the soft terms conserve individual lepton numbers and do\nnot cause large flavor or CP violations. The vacuum adjusts so as to allow\nlarge sparticle splittings to naturally coexist with flavor conservation.\nConsequently, the resulting phenomenology is different from that of minimal\nsupersymmetric theories. We also propose theories in which the shape of the\nsoft terms in flavor space is a dynamical variable which depends on fields that\nhave no tree level potential. This dynamically leads to partial degeneracy\namong sparticles and further supression of flavor violations. The ideas of this\npaper suggest a connection between the space of moduli and the spontaneously\nbroken flavor group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 1995 14:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 1995 16:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We describe a new heuristic technique, path optimization, and its\napplication to two variations of graph partitioning: the max_cut problem and\nthe min_quotient_cut problem. We present the results of computational\ncomparisons between this technique and the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, the\nsimulated annealing algorithm, the FLOW-lagorithm the multilevel algorithm, and\nteh recent 0.878-approximation algorithm. The experiments were conducted on two\nclasses of graphs that have become standard for such tests: random and random\ngeometric. They show that for both classes of inputs and both variations of the\nproblem, the new heuristic is competitive with the other algorithms and holds\nan advantage for min_quotient_cut when applied to very large, sparse geometric\ngraphs. In the last part of the paper, we describe an approach to analyzing\ngraph partitioning algorithms from the statistical point of view. Every\npartitioning of a graph is viewed as a result achieved by a \"near gready\"\npartitioning algorithm. The experiments show that for \"good\" partitionings, the\nnumber of non-greedy steps needed to obtain them is quite small; moreover, it\nis \"statistically\" smaller for better partitionings. This led us to conjecture\nthat there exists an \"optimal\" distribution of the non-greedy steps that\ncharacterize the classes of graphs that we studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
