Both surveys are\ncomplete to an apparent magnitude limit $B(0)=15.5$. Our sample includes 12,812\ngalaxies distributed in a volume $1.8 \\times 10^6 \\hmpc3$. We conclude: 1) The\npairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the combined CfA2+SSRS2 redshift\nsurvey is $\\sig12=540 \\kms \\pm 180 \\kms$. Both the estimate and the variance of\n$\\sig12$ significantly exceed the canonical values $\\sig12=340 \\pm40$ measured\nby Davis \\& Peebles (1983) using CfA1. 2) We derive the uncertainty in $\\sig12$\nfrom the variation among subsamples with volumes on the order of $7 \\times\n10^5$ \\hmpc3. This variation is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the\nformal error, 36 $\\kms$, derived using least-squares fits to the CfA2+SSRS2\ncorrelation function. This variation among samples is consistent with the\nconclusions of Mo \\etal (1993) for a number of smaller surveys and with the\nanalysis of CfA1 by Zurek \\etal (1994). 3) When we remove Abell clusters with\n$R\\ge1$ from our sample, the pairwise velocity dispersion of the remaining\ngalaxies drops to $295 \\pm 99 \\kms$. Thus the dominant source of variance in\n$\\sig12$ is the shot noise contributed by dense virialized systems. 4) The\ndistribution of pairwise velocities is consistent with an isotropic exponential\nwith velocity dispersion independent of scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 1995 20:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
