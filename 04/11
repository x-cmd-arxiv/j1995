Simulation is an arguable unique union of modeling and computation.\nHowever, simulation also qualifies as a separate species of system\nrepresentation with its own motivations, characteristics, and implications.\nThis work outlines how simulation can be rooted in mathematics and shows which\nproperties some of the elements of such a mathematical framework has. The\nproperties of simulation are described and analyzed in terms of properties of\ndynamical systems. It is shown how and why a simulation produces emergent\nbehavior and why the analysis of the dynamics of the system being simulated\nalways is an analysis of emergent phenomena. A notion of a universal simulator\nand the definition of simulatability is proposed. This allows a description of\nconditions under which simulations can distribute update functions over system\ncomponents, thereby determining simulatability. The connection between the\nnotion of simulatability and the notion of computability is defined and the\nconcepts are distinguished. The basis of practical detection methods for\ndetermining effectively non-simulatable systems in practice is presented. The\nconceptual framework is illustrated through examples from molecular\nself-assembly end engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 1995 18:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The dependence of the triton binding energy\non the $\\pi NN$ cut-off parameter in the three-nucleon potentials is studied\nand found to be reduced compared to the case with pure $\\pi$ exchange. The\n$\\rho$ exchange parts of the three-nucleon potential yield an overall repulsive\neffect. When the recommended parameters are employed, the calculated triton\nbinding energy turns out to be very close to its experimental value.\nExpectation values of various components of the three-nucleon potential are\ngiven to illustrate their significance for binding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 1995 22:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A recently developed formalism, based\non the antinormal ordering of exponential phase operators, is used for studying\nphase properties and number-phase uncertainty relations. This study shows\nessential differences between properties of the Barut-Girardello states and the\nSU(1,1) coherent states. The philophase states, defined as states with simple\nphase-state representations, relate the quantum description of the optical\nphase to the properties of the SU(1,1) Lie group. A modified Holstein-Primakoff\nrealization is derived, and eigenstates of the corresponding lowering generator\nare discussed. These states are shown to contract, in a proper limit, to the\nfamiliar Glauber coherent states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 1995 15:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
