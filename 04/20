Recent observations of the size and velocity of Ly-alpha\nforest clouds have indicated that the Ly-alpha absorption is probably not given\nby collapsed objects, but pre-collapsed regions in the baryonic density field.\nTherefore, a linear approximation description would be able to provide valuable\ninformation. We developed a technique to simulate Ly-alpha forest as the\nabsorption of such pre-collapsed regions under linear approximation regime. The\nsimulated Ly-alpha forests in models of the standard cold dark matter (SCDM),\nthe cold plus hot dark matter (CHDM), and the low-density flat cold dark matter\n(LCDM) have been confronted with observational features, including 1) the\nnumber density of Ly-alpha lines and its dependencies on redshift and\nequivalent width; 2) the distribution of equivalent widths and its redshift\ndependence; 3) clustering; and 4) the Gunn-Peterson effect. The \"standard\" CHDM\nmodel, i.e. 60% cold and 30% hot dark matters and 10\\% baryons, is found to be\ndifficult to pass the Ly-alpha forest test, probably because it produces\nstructures too late and favors to form structures on large scales instead of\nsmall scale objects like Ly-alpha clouds. Within a reasonable range of J_nu,\nthe UV background radiation at high redshift, and delta_th, the threshold of\nthe onset of gravitational collapse of the baryonic matter, the LCDM model is\nconsistent with observational data in all above-mentioned four aspects. The\nmodel of SCDM can also fit with observation, but it requires a smaller J_nu and\na higher delta_th. This suggests that whether a significant part of the\nLy-alpha forest lines is located in the halos of collapsed objects would be\ncrucial to the success of SCDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 1995 00:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

After\na short introduction on strings in Minkowski and curved spacetimes, we focus on\nstrings in cosmological spacetimes. The classical behaviour of strings in FRW\nand inflationary spacetimes is now understood in a large extent from various\ntypes of explicit string solutions. Three different types of behaviour appear\nin cosmological spacetimes: {\\bf unstable, dual} to unstable and {\\bf stable}.\nFor the unstable strings, the energy and size grow for large scale factors $R\n\\to \\infty$, proportional to $R$. For the dual to unstable strings, the energy\nand size blow up for $R\\to 0$ as $1/R$. For stable strings, the energy and\nproper size are bounded. (In Minkowski spacetime, all string solutions are of\nthe stable type).Recent progress on self-consistent solutions to the Einstein\nequations for string dominated universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum\ntensor for a gas of strings is then considered as source of the spacetime\ngeometry and from the above string behaviours the string equation of state is\ndetermined. The self-consistent string solution exhibits the realistic matter\ndominated behaviour $R \\sim (X^0)^{2/3}\\; $ for large times and the radiation\ndominated behaviour $R \\sim (X^0)^{1/2}\\;$ for early times. Finally, we report\non the exact integrability of the string equations plus the constraints in de\nSitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\\bf exact} string\nsolutions by soliton methods and the multistring solutions. {\\bf Multistring\nsolutions} are a new feature in curved spacetimes. That is, a single\nworld-sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings.\nThis phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime and follows to the coupling\nof the strings with the geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 1995 17:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 1995 12:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The\nrelevant equations can be interpreted easily, analogously to simple\nprobabilistic considerations. They provide an improved understanding of the\naddition of angular momenta as well as a practicable evaluation of\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients in an easier way than within the well-known\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 1995 11:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
