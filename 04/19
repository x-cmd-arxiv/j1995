A finite-difference method was\nused to solve the full hydrodynamic field equations numerically. Structure and\ndynamics of these localized traveling waves (LTW) are dominated by the\nconcentration field. Like in the spatially extended convective states ( cf.\naccompanying paper), the Soret-induced concentration variations strongly\ninfluence, via density changes, the buoyancy forces that drive convection. The\nspatio-temporal properties of this feed-back mechanism, involving boundary\nlayers and concentration plumes, show that LTW's are strongly nonlinear states.\nLight intensity distributions are determined that can be observed in side-view\nshadowgraphs. Detailed analyses of all fields are made using colour-coded\nisoplots, among others. In the frame comoving with their drift velocity, LTW's\ndisplay a nontrivial spatio-temporal symmetry consisting of time-translation by\nhalf an oscillation period combined with vertical reflection through the\nhorizontal midplane of the layer. A time-averaged concentration current is\ndriven by a phase difference between the waves of concentration and vertical\nvelocity in the bulk of the LTW state. The associated large-scale concentration\nredistribution stabilizes the LTW and controls its drift velocity into the\nquiescent fluid by generating a buoyancy-reducing concentration \"barrier\" ahead\nof the leading LTW front. The selection of the width of the LTW's is\ninvestigated and comparisons with experiments are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 1995 16:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
