We stress the\npotential interest of this technique in all those cosmological problems in\nwhich the determination of a non-Gaussian signature is relevant, e.g. in the\nanalysis of large scale structure and cosmic microwave background. A first\nimportant result is that the asymptotic confidence limits on the parameters are\nsystematically widened when the higher order correlation functions are\npositive, with respect to the Gaussian case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 1995 14:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Link invariants are also shown to survive the coupling to\na certain kind of matter (hyperinstantons). The physical relevance of\ntopological field theory and its invariants is discovered. By embedding\ntopological Yang-Mills theory into pure Yang-Mills theory, it is shown that the\ntopological version TQFT of a quantum field theory QFT allows us to formulate\nconsistently the perturbative expansion of QFT in the topologically nontrivial\nsectors. In particular, TQFT classifies the set of good measures over the\ninstanton moduli space and solves the inconsistency problems of the previous\napproaches. The qualitatively new physical implications are pointed out. Link\nnumbers in QCD are related to a non abelian analogoue of the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 1995 12:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 1995 01:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
