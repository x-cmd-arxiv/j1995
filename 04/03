These two sources\nappear point-like in images taken with the {\\sl ROSAT} HRI. One of the sources\nis most likely associated with a close spectroscopic binary R140a2 (WN6) with\nan orbital period of 2.76 days. The mass of the unknown binary component is\nlikely in the range of $2.4 - 15{\\rm~M}_\\odot$. This suggests that the X-ray\nsource could represent a long-sought class of binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet\nstar and a black hole. The other source, which coincides spatially with Mk34\n(WN4.5), may have a similar nature. Available X-ray spectral data support this\nWolf-Rayet + black-hole binary explanation of the two sources. I have used a\n{\\sl ROSAT} PSPC observation to show that the sources have ultrasoft spectra\nwith possible intrinsic absorption. Modeled with multicolor blackbody disks,\nthe spectra provide estimates of the disks' characteristic inner radii, which\nare in agreement with those obtained for the known black-hole candidates. An\n{\\sl ASCA} observation has further revealed a hard X-ray spectral component\nfrom the central 30 Doradus region. This component, represented by a power law\nwith a photon index of $\\sim 2.4$, may belong to the two sources. The\ncharacteristics of both the power-law and ultrasoft components strongly\nindicates that the two sources are black-hole candidates in high-mass X-ray\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 1995 20:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
