The two types of dark matter arise\nentirely within the neutrino sector and do not require separate physical\norigins. We calculate the linear transfer functions for a representative sample\nof warm-plus-hot models. The transfer functions, and results from several\nobservational tests of structure formation, are compared with those for the\ncold-plus-hot models that have been studied extensively in the literature. On\nthe basis of these tests, we conclude that warm-plus-hot dark matter is\nessentially indistinguishable from cold-plus-hot dark matter, and therefore\nprovides a viable scenario for large scale structure.

Integrating out the meson field and neglecting\nthe nucleon vacuum polarization one obtains an effective action in terms of the\nheavy particle coordinates which is nonlocal in the proper time. As in\nFeynman's polaron approach we approximate this action by a retarded quadratic\naction whose parameters are to be determined variationally on the pole of the\ntwo-point function. Several ans\\\"atze for the retardation function are studied\nand for the most general case we derive a system of coupled variational\nequations. An approximate analytic solution displays the instability of the\nsystem for coupling constants beyond a critical value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 1995 21:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

This comparison shows that the large enhancement of\nstrangeness observed in $S+Au$ collisions, interpreted previously as possible\nevidence for quark-gluon plasma formation, has its origins in non-equilibrium\ndynamics of few nucleon systems. % Strangeness enhancement %is therefore traced\nback to the change in the production dynamics %from $pp$ to minimum bias $pS$\nand central $SS$ collisions. A factor of two enhancement of $\\Lambda^{0}$ at\nmid-rapidity is indicated by recent $pS$ data, where on the average {\\em one}\nprojectile nucleon interacts with only {\\em two} target nucleons.
