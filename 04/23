The high density of $e^+e^-$ pairs in such fireballs\ninevitably makes them opaque to gamma-rays and requires the gamma-ray emission\nto take place only after the fireball has expanded and became optically thin to\ngamma's. Many of the ``traditional'' scenarios explain the temporal variability\nof GRBs as being formed by growing instabilities in the expanding fireball.\nHere we explore this possiblity and examine its validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 1995 16:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

(2) For a system of high density nuclear matter,\nbased on the chiral sigma model, we find that a strict first order phase\ntransition to quark matter is not favoured. This does not, of course, preclude\na phase transition of second order. However, we have not investigated the\nlatter problem. (3) The mass formulae for finite lumps of strange quark matter\nwith $u,~d$ and $s$ quarks and non-strange quark matter are derived in a\nnon-relativistic approach, taking into account the finite size effects such as\nsurface and curvature. We find that there is a good possibility for the\nformation of metastable strangelets of large mass detectable in experiment. (4)\nThe maximum mass for stable neutron stars predicted by our equation of state\nfor ($n,~p,~e$) matter is 2.59 times the solar mass. The corresponding radius\n($R$), crustal length ($\\Delta$) and surface red shift ratio ($\\alpha$) are\n14.03 $km$, 1.0 $km$ and 0.674 respectively. The maximum moment of inertia is\n$4.79 \\times 10^{45}~g~cm^{2}$. These suggest that our equation of state for\nneutron star matter is comparatively ``stiff\". (5) The neutrino emissivity from\ntwo and three flavour quark matter is numerically calculated and compared with\nthe result given by Iwamoto. We find that the emissivity is smaller than\nIwamoto's result by about two orders of magnitude when\n$p_{f}(u)+p_{f}(e)-p_{f}(d(s))$ is comparable to the temperature. We attribute\nthis to the severe restriction imposed by momentum conservation on the phase\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 1995 18:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 1995 03:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 May 1995 20:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
