In the case that $\\L$ is not the class of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay\nsubschemes, we associate to any $X \\in \\L$ two invariants $\\theta_X$ and\n$\\eta_X$. When taken with the height $h_X$, each of these invariants determines\nthe location of $X$ in $\\L$, thought of as a poset under domination. In terms\nof these invariants, necessary conditions are given for integral subschemes.\nThe necessary conditions are almost sufficient in the sense that if a subscheme\n$X$ satisfies the necessary conditions and dominates an integral subscheme $Y$,\nthen $X$ can be deformed with constant cohomology through subschemes in $\\L$ to\nan integral subscheme. In particular, if an even linkage class has a minimal\nelement which is integral, then the conditions are both necessary and\nsufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 1995 20:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Besides gravitational\nforces, GRAPE also returns the list of neighbours and can, therefore, be used\nto speed up the hydrodynamical part, too. After the interaction list has been\npassed, density, pressure forces, propagation and interpolation of particles\netc. are calculated on the front end, a 50 MHz SUN SPARC 10. In order to\ncombine SPH and GRAPE, possible limitations due to the hardware design of GRAPE\nare carefully analyzed and modifications compared to current SPH codes are\ndiscussed. The resulting code, GRAPESPH, is similarly flexible as TREESPH. It\nseems especially well suited to investigate the formation of individual objects\nin a large scale structure environment, like eg. galaxies or clusters. The\ntotal performance is at least half as good as treesph on a CRAY and for most\napplications it seems to be even better. The CPU time per time step is only\nslightly dependent on the clustering state. GRAPESPH, therefore, provides a\nvery attractive alternative to the use of supercomputers in cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 1995 21:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This effect\nis referred to as ``scrambling'', and is interpreted in transformational\nframeworks as leftward movement of the arguments. Furthermore, arguments from\nan embedded clause may move out of their clause; this effect is referred to as\n``long-distance scrambling''. While scrambling has recently received\nconsiderable attention in the syntactic literature, the status of long-distance\nscrambling has only rarely been addressed. The reason for this is the\nproblematic status of the data: not only is long-distance scrambling highly\ndependent on pragmatic context, it also is strongly subject to degradation due\nto processing constraints. As in the case of center-embedding, it is not\nimmediately clear whether to assume that observed unacceptability of highly\ncomplex sentences is due to grammatical restrictions, or whether we should\nassume that the competence grammar does not place any restrictions on\nscrambling (and that, therefore, all such sentences are in fact grammatical),\nand the unacceptability of some (or most) of the grammatically possible word\norders is due to processing limitations. In this paper, we will argue for the\nsecond view by presenting a processing model for German.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 1995 19:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

For a typical chaotic inflation\npotential, the solutions for the probability distribution never become\nstationary but grow forever towards larger values of the fields. We show here\nthat a non-minimal conformal coupling of the inflaton to the curvature scalar,\nas well as radiative corrections to the effective potential, may provide a\ndynamical cutoff and generate stationary solutions.
