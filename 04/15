Large corrections for unseen LiII and for\nnon-gas phase lithium have provided obstacles to using interstellar data for\nabundance determinations. An approach to surmounting these difficulties is\nproposed and is applied to the Galaxy and the LMC. The key is that since\npotassium and lithium behave similarly regarding ionization and depletion,\ntheir observed ratio (LiI/KI) can be used to probe the abundance and evolution\nof lithium. For ten lines-of-sight in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy\n(ISM) the Li/K ratio observed $(\\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM} = - 1.88 \\pm 0.09)$ is\nentirely consistent with the solar system value $(\\log (N_{Li}/N_{K})_{\\odot} =\n- 1.82 \\pm 0.05)$. The absence of LiI in front of SN87A in the LMC, coupled\nwith the observed KI, corresponds to an upper bound (at $\\rsim 95 \\% \\ CL$) of\n$\\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{LMC} < - 0.3 + \\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM}.$ This low upper\nbound to LMC lithium suggests that cosmic lithium is on its way up from a\nprimordial abundance lower, by at least a factor of two, than the present Pop I\nvalue of $[Li]_{PopI} \\equiv 12 + \\log (Li/H)_{PopI} = 3.2 \\pm 0.1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 1995 19:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Following Buote & Tsai we probed the aggregate structure\nof the clusters on scales $\\sim 1.5h^{-1}_{80}$ Mpc to reduce effects of\npossible substructure on smaller scales ($\\lesssim$ a few hundred kpc). The\nellipticities of the X-ray isophotes are typically $\\epsilon\\approx 0.15 -\n0.25$ and display negative radial gradients significant (except Coma).
