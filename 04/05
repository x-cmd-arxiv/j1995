The additional fact that the gas is cooling in the center has often\nled one to expect that the gas temperature should be lower near the center, and\ntherefore the gas should be more concentrated than the dark matter. We show\nthat such expectation is not correct, and that the gas temperature must remain\napproximately constant within the cooling region in order to have consistency\nwith the observed X-ray profiles and lenses. A multiphase cooling flow\nnaturally produces an approximately constant temperature profile, and a more\nextended distribution for the gas compared to the mass. Cool phases are\ndeposited at relatively large radius, while hot phases are adiabatically heated\nas they flow inwards and can keep the average temperature constant. Thus,\ncooling flows result in an {\\it increase} of the central temperature, relative\nto a case where there is no cooling and the gas follows the mass distribution.\n  The increased central temperatures caused by cooling flows give a\ncharacteristic core radius to the gas profiles, which is of order the cooling\nradius. This provides a natural explanation for the typical cores observed in\nX-ray clusters. It also brings into better agreement with observations the rate\nof cluster evolution expected in self-similar hierarchical models.
