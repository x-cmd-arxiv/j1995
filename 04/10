The contradiction originates in the fact that the\nstandard factorization assumption approximates the asymptotic final states by a\nnon-orthogonal set of states, thus leading to an overcounting of the decay\nprobability. We consider a system with two heavy quarks treated as classical\ncolor sources with constant velocity, and two mass-degenerate antiquarks.\nExploiting permutation symmetry in an adiabatic approximation, we find that\nfinal state interaction restores duality. Three $O(1/N_c)$ effects are\nexhibited: i) a proper treatment of orthogonality yields a global correction\n$1/N_c\\to 1/2N_c$ within a generalized factorization \\`a la BSW, (such a factor\nwas present in an Ansatz by Shifman), ii) the distorsion of the meson wave\nfunctions at the time of the weak decay, iii) relative phases generated by the\nlater evolution.
