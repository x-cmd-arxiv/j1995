Ten individual sources are\nfound. Three sources (X-1, X-2 and X-3 [SN~1978K]) are very bright (~10^40\nerg/s) and are unusual in that analogous objects do not exist in our Galaxy. We\npresent an X-ray image of NGC~1313 and \\xray spectra for the three bright\nsources. The emission from the nuclear region (R ~< 2 kpc) is dominated by\nsource X-1, which is located ~1 kpc north of the photometric (and dynamical)\ncenter of NGC~1313. Optical, far-infrared and radio images do not indicate the\npresence of an active galactic nucleus at that position; however, the compact\nnature of the \\xray source (X-1) suggests that it is an accretion-powered\nobject with central mass M >~ 10^3 Msun. Additional emission (L_X ~ 10^39\nerg/s) in the nuclear region extends out to ~2.6 kpc and roughly follows the\nspiral arms. This emission is from 4 sources with luminosity of several x 10^38\nerg/s, two of which are consistent with emission from population I sources\n(e.g., supernova remnants, and hot interstellar gas which has been heated by\nsupernova remnants). The other two sources could be emission from population II\nsources (e.g., low-mass \\xray binaries). The bright sources X-2 and SN~1978K\nare positioned in the southern disk of NGC~1313. X-2 is variable and has no\noptical counterpart brighter than 20.8 mag (V-band). It is likely that it is an\naccretion-powered object in NGC~1313.

Quantum mechanics predicts that this\nlimit can be exceeded, making it nonlocal. We analyse the effect of an\nenvironment modelled by a fluctuating magnetic field on the quantum\ncorrelations in an EPR singlet as seen in the Bell inequality. We show that in\nan EPR setup, the system goes from the usual 'violation' of Bell inequality to\na 'non-violation' for times larger than a characteristic time scale which is\nrelated to the parameters of the fluctuating field. We also look at these\ninequalities as a function of the spatial separation between the EPR pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 1995 16:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The dissipative interaction leads to\ndecoherence in the superposition states of the apparatus, making its behaviour\nclassical in the sense that the density matrix becomes diagonal with time.\nSince the apparatus is also interacting with the system, the probabilities of\nthe diagonal density matrix are determined by the state vector of the system.\nWe consider a Stern-Gerlach type model, where a spin- 1/2 particle is in an\ninhomogeneous magnetic field, the whole set up being in contact with a large\nenvironment. Here we find that the density matrix of the combined system and\napparatus becomes diagonal and the momentum of the particle becomes correlated\nwith a spin operator, selected by the choice of the system-apparatus\ninteraction. This allows for a measurement of spin via a momentum measurement\non the particle with associated probabilities in accordance with quantum\nprinciples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 1995 16:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
