Resonance lines, due both to intrinsic emission and scattering, are\nparticularly prominent in the soft X-ray band.\n  When our line of sight to the nucleus is not obscured, the dominant effect is\nabsorption. In the soft X-ray band, ionization edges of highly ionized species\nand resonance lines contribute comparably to the opacity; in the ultraviolet,\nthe gas is almost transparent except for a small number of resonance lines. We\nidentify the \"warm absorbers\" seen in many AGN X-ray spectra with this gas, but\nargue that most of the UV absorption lines seen must be due to a small amount\nof more weakly ionized gas which is embedded in the main body of the warm,\nreflecting gas.

As the orbit of a satellite decays through\ndynamical friction, the primary disk develops large-amplitude spirals in\nresponse to its tidal forcing. While these features arise in both the stars and\nthe gas in the disk, the non--axisymmetric structures in the gas differ\nslightly from those in the stars. In particular, as a consequence of the\nformation of strong shocks in the gas and the effects of radiative cooling, the\ngas response tends to lead the stellar response, enabling the stars to strongly\ntorque the gas. These torques deprive the gas of its angular momentum, forcing\na significant fraction of it into the inner regions of the disk. The radial\ninflows induced by these mergers accumulate large quantities of interstellar\ngas in the nuclear regions of the host disks. In some cases, nearly half of all\nthe gas initially distributed throughout the disk winds up in a dense ``cloud''\nseveral hundred parsecs in extent. The models reported here do not include star\nformation and, so, we cannot determine the ultimate fate of the gas.\nNevertheless, given the high densities in the nuclear gas, it is plausible to\nidentify these concentrations of dense gas in the remnants with those\naccompanying intense starbursts in some active galaxies. Therefore, the\ncalculations here provide a framework for interpreting the origin of nuclear\nactivity in otherwise quiescent disk galaxies. To the extent that galaxy\nformation is a chaotic process in which large structures are built up by the\naccretion of smaller fragments, our models may also be relevant to starbursts\nand the onset of nuclear activity in proto--galaxies at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 1995 21:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The\nNeveu-Schwarz (NS) sector is the direct sum of an $h = 0$ and an $h = 1/2$\nmodule, and the Ramond (R) sector is the direct sum of two copies of an $h =\n1/16$ module. In addition to the fundamental fermions, which represent a\nClifford algebra, and the Virasoro operators, there are infinitely many other\nvertex operators, in one-to-one correspondence with the vectors (states) in the\nNS sector.

The main\nobjective is to find a generalization of the VOSA Jacobi-Cauchy identity which\nis satisfied by these intertwining operators. There are several novel features\nof this new ``Matrix'' Jacobi-Cauchy Identity (MJCI), most of which come from\nthe fact that correlation functions made from two intertwiners are\nhypergeometric functions. In order to relate and rationalize the correlation\nfunctions we use the Kummer quadratic transformation formulas, lifting the\nfunctions to a four-sheeted covering, branched over the usual three poles,\nwhere the Cauchy residue theorem can be applied. The six possible poles on the\ncover give six terms in the MJCI.
