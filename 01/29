The purpose of this paper is to expose these\ndifficulties and show how they can be remedied, thus recovering a well-defined\ndescription of plasmas even in a finite-size, canonical ensemble setting.

This formalism is advantageous for the analysis of\nelectromagnetic interactions because current conservation and four momentum\nconservation are realized within a three-dimensional formalism. Wave functions\nare required in a frame where the total momentum is nonzero, which means that\nthe usual partial wave analysis is inapplicable. In this work, the\nthree-dimensional equation is solved numerically, taking into account the\nrelevant symmetries. A dynamical boost of the interaction also is needed for\nthe instant formalism, which in general requires that the boosted interaction\nbe defined as the solution of a four-dimensional equation. For the case of a\nscalar separable interaction, this equation is solved and the Lorentz\ninvariance of the three-dimensional formulation using the boosted interaction\nis verified. For more realistic interactions, a simple approximation is used to\ncharacterize the boost of the interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 1995 21:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
