A similar regularization can be performed\nin field theory. For the IR regularized string ground states we derive the\nexact one-loop effective action for non-zero U(1) or chromo-magnetic fields as\nwell as gravitational and axionic-dilatonic fields. This effective action is IR\nand UV finite. Thus, the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational,\ngauge and Yukawas) are unabiguously computed. These corrections are necessary\nfor quantitative string superunification predictions at low energies. The\none-loop corrections to the couplings are also found to satisfy Infrared Flow\nEquations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 1995 15:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 1995 18:14:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 1995 20:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 1995 16:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 1995 17:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
