The energy loss mechanisms we consider in our calculations include\nmagnetic Compton scattering of thermal x-ray photons, triplet pair production,\nand curvature radiation emission. The electron acceleration mechanism is\nassumed to operate only to a height above the polar cap approximately equal to\nthe polar cap radius. We find several interesting results. First, magnetic\nCompton scattering is the dominant energy loss process when the electron\nLorentz factors are < few x10^6 for typical gamma-ray pulsar magnetic fields\nand surface temperatures measured by ROSAT. The amount of energy converted to\nphotons by accelerated electrons ranges from ~10% to ~100% of gamma_0 mc^2\nwhere gamma_0 is the maximum Lorentz factor an electron can attain with no\nradiative losses. We also find that if B > 10^13 G and T > 3x10^6 K, the\nLorentz factors of the electrons can be limited to values < 10^3 assuming\nvalues for the size of the neutron star thermal polar cap comparable to the\npolar cap size determined by the open field lines. Such small Lorentz factors\nmay be capable of explaining the gamma-ray emission from PSR 1509-58 which is\nobserved only at energies <1 MeV. We calculated the fraction of the electron's\nkinetic energy that is converted to gamma rays for the three gamma-ray pulsars\nwhich show thermal x-ray spectra, namely Vela (60%), Geminga (5%), and PSR\n1055-52 (20%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 1995 19:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Selected [Fe/H]~ -1.6\nisochrones from Bergbusch & VandenBerg (1992, ApJS, 81, 163) and Straniero &\nChieffi (1991, ApJS, 76, 525) are transformed onto the near-infrared\nobservational plane, and these suggest an age for M13 in the range 14-16 Gyr.\nWe emphasize that any effort to estimate ages should be considered as tentative\ngiven uncertainties in the input physics; however, these uncertainties\nnotwithstanding, comparisons between the near-infrared isochrones indicate that\nage differences of order +/-2 Gyr should be detectable among metal-poor\nclusters on the K, J-K plane. Building on this result, we find that the\ndifference in J-K color between the MSTO and the base of the RGB in M13 is the\nsame as in M4, and conclude that these clusters have similar ages. This\nconclusion is verified by comparing (1) the K brightnesses of the MSTO, and (2)\nthe morphologies of optical CMDs.
