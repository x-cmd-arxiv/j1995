The definition is acquired by studying collections of training\nexamples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning\nproblems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the\ndecision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning\nalgorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and\napplication of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output\nrepresentations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique\nin which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output\nrepresentation. We show that these output representations improve the\ngeneralization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of\nmulticlass learning tasks.

Currently the most important application of these methods is to\ntemporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of\nTD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general\nimplementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement\nlearning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional\napproach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both\ninefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences)\nprocedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates\nTD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used\nwith arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is\nderived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far.\nEncouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda\n&gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning\nspeedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
