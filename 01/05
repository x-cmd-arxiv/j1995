A motivation for the soliton description of baryons is\nprovided from large $N_C$ QCD. Rigorous results on the spontaneous breaking of\nchiral symmetry in QCD are discussed. It is then argued that the NJL model\nprovides a fair description of low--energy hadron physics. The NJL model is\ntherefore employed to mimic the low--energy chiral flavor dynamics of QCD. The\nmodel is bosonized by functional integral techniques and the physical content\nof the emerging effective meson theory is discussed. In particular, its\nrelation to the Skyrme model is established. The static soliton solutions of\nthe bosonized NJL model are found, their properties discussed, and the\ninfluence of various meson fields studied. These considerations provide strong\nsupport of Witten's conjecture that baryons can be understood as soliton\nsolutions of effective meson theories. The chiral soliton of the NJL model is\nthen quantized in a semiclassical fashion and various static properties of the\nnucleon are studied. The dominating $1/N_C$ corrections to the semiclassically\nquantized soliton are investigated. Time--dependent meson fluctuations off the\nchiral soliton are explored and employed to estimate the quantum corrections to\nthe soliton mass. Finally, hyperons are described as chiral solitons of the NJL\nmodel.

Depending on the amount of supercooling, the maximal velocity of\nsupersonic deflagrations varies between the sound and the light velocities.
