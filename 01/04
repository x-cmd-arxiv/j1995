The mobility tensor of PHD is calculated using combined analytical and\nnumerical approach. The results for the velocity of PHD climbing in slightly\nnon-optimal hexagonal patterns are compared with numerical simulations of\namplitude equations. Interaction of penta-hepta defects in optimal hexagonal\npatterns is also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 1995 23:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
