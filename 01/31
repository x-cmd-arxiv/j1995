The BCGs in the\nclusters EMSS0839+29, EMSS1455+22 and Abell2390 are complicated by ionized gas,\nwhich is detected over large portions of all three systems. Radial color\nvariations are detected in the majority of galaxies and, for those systems not\nshowing extended [OII] emission, the weakening of D4000 (which measures the\n4000 Angstrom break in magnitudes) with radius falls in the upper range of what\nis seen among nearby ellipticals. However, there is no correlation between\nlocal D4000 values and (g-r), suggesting that these quantities are sensitive to\ndifferent parameters. We estimate the metallicity sensitivity of D4000 using a\ncombination of observational and theoretical data, and find metallicity\ngradients for BCGs which are relatively steep, and in qualitative agreement\nwith predictions for galaxies which experience a single monolithic dissipative\ncollapse. Line gradients measured with respect to g surface brightness show\nexcellent galaxy-to-galaxy consistency, and are in good agreement with what has\nbeen measured in Coma cluster galaxies. The presence of significant stellar\npopulation gradients in the BCGs suggests that the material from which they\nformed experienced dissipation during the collapse phases, and it seems likely\nthat these galaxies could not have formed solely from the merging of gas-poor\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 1995 21:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
