We present a method\nfor estimating the critical coupling strength below which these stationary\nstates persist in the network. In some cases, the presence of time-independent\nlocalized states in the system can be regarded as a `propagation failure'\nphenomenon. We analyse this type of behaviour in the case of diffusive networks\nwhose elements are described by one or two variables and give concrete\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 1995 12:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
