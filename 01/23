My conclusion is\nthat, necessary and sufficient conditions of stability are obtained when we\nhave only two mode coupling in the gyroscopic terms of the perturbed\nLagrangian. To illustrate the power of this new energy principle, I have\ncalculated the stability limits of two dimensional configurations such as\nordinary Maclaurin disk, an infinite self gravitating rotating sheet, and a two\ndimensional Rayleigh flow which has well known sufficient conditions of\nstability. All perturbations considered are in the same plane as the\nconfigurations. The limits of stability are identical with those given by a\ndynamical analysis when available, and with the results of the strong energy\nprinciple analysis when given.

The physical properties,\nstring length, energy and pressure are computed and analyzed. We find the {\\it\nback-reaction} effect of these strings on the spacetime: the self-consistent\nsolution to the Einstein equations is a spatially closed $(K>0)$ spacetime with\na selected value of the curvature index $K$ (the scale f* is normalized to\nunity). No self-consistent solutions with $K\\leq 0$ exist. We semi-classically\nquantize the circular strings and find the mass $m$ in each case.
