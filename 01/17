To isolate the various physical\naffects included in the new rotation plus diffusion models we also constructed\nsolar models to test the significance of diffusion and of overshoot by\nthemselves. In previous studies, models that include helium diffusion during\nsolar evolution were found to improve the predicted p-mode frequencies for some\nmodes and worsen the agreement for others (Guenther \\ea 1993). Here we verify\nthis result for both the Bahcall and Loeb (1990) formulation of diffusion and\nthe Proffitt and Michaud (1991) formulation of diffusion. We find that the\neffects of rotation on the Sun's structure in the outer layers perturbs the\n$p$-mode frequencies only slightly when compared to the more substantial\neffects due to diffusion. In the thin overshoot layer (taken here to be $0.1\\,\nH_p$), we have compared the effect of overmixing in a radiative layer versus\nconvective (adiabatic) penetration. Neither radiative overmixing nor adiabatic\npenetration has any significant effect on the $p$-modes, probably in part\nbecause the overshoot layer is constrained to be thin.
