The projection operators\nconstructed in terms of $C_n$ for the various irreps of $H_n(q)$ are\nwell-behaved in the limit $q\\rightarrow 1$, even when approaching degenerate\neigenvalues of $[(2)]_n$. In the latter case, for which the irreps of $S_n$ are\nnot fully characterized by the corresponding eigenvalue of the transposition\nclass-sum, the limiting form of the projection operator constructed in terms of\n$C_n$ gives rise to factors that depend on higher class-sums of $S_n$, which\neffect the desired characterization.
