The functional integral representation displays a complex measure, with\na crucial role of the boundary conditions, and the decomposition into theta\nsectors takes place already in finite volume. In the infinite volume limit, the\nstandard results are reproduced for M=0 (massless fermions), but one meets\nsubstantial differences for M not = 0: for generic boundary conditions,\nindependently of the lagrangean angle of the topological term, the infinite\nvolume limit selects the sector with theta = theta_M, and provides a natural\n\"dynamical\" solution of the strong CP problem. In comparison with previous\napproaches, the strategy discussed here allows to exploit the consequences of\nthe theta-dependence of the free energy density, with a unique minimum at theta\n= theta_M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 1995 14:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
