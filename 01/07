Owing to the use of\na global description of the gravitational field, the particles in an SCF\nsimulation do not interact with one another directly, minimizing communications\noverhead between nodes in a parallel implementation. Ideal load-balancing is\nachieved since precisely the same number of operations are needed to compute\nthe acceleration for each particle. Consequently, the SCF technique is\nperfectly scalable and the size of feasible applications will grow in simple\nproportion to advances in computational hardware. We describe an SCF code\ndeveloped for and tested on a Connection Machine 5. Empirical tests demonstrate\nthe efficient and scalable nature of the algorithm.
