Single adatoms on the\n(111) surface of Al and Cu are studied with the self-consistent surface\nGreen-function method by which the pure adsorbate-substrate interaction may be\nanalyzed. Higher coverage ordered adlayers of K on Al(111), Na on Al(111), and\nNa on Al(001) are treated using the <em>ab-initio</em> pseudopotential plane\nwave method which affords the prediction of coverage dependent stable and\nmetastable adsorbate geometries and phase transitions of the adsorbate layers.\nTogether, these studies give insight and understanding into current key issues\nin alkali metal adsorption, namely, the nature of the adsorbate-substrate bond\nat low coverage and the occurrence of hitherto unanticipated adsorbate\ngeometries, and the associated electronic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 1995 16:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 1995 14:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

It is shown how the source\nterms agitating the modes can be obtained from the basic BL correlation kernel\nby a simple projection onto the associated dual basis states, which are\nproportional to the RPA amplitudes and can be expressed explicitly. The source\nterms for the correlated agitation of any two such modes can then be extracted\ndirectly, without consideration of the other modes. This facilitates the\nanalysis of collective modes in unstable matter and makes it possible to asses\nthe accuracy of an approximate projection technique employed previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 1995 19:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
