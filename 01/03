In the gas pressure region, two distinct solutions are obtained. In one,\nthe convective flux is much larger than the radiative flux and the blackbody\nregion extends over the entire gas pressure region and could also extend down\nto the inner boundary of the disk. In this solution the temperature profile is\nclose to adiabatic. In the other solution, the convective flux is about a third\nof the total flux, and there exist the gas pressure blackbody and electron\nscattering regions as well as the radiation pressure region. In the radiation\npressure region, the temperature profile is very close to adiabatic, and the\ndisk is geometrically thin and optically thick even for super Eddington\naccretion rates. The fraction of the convective flux, out of the total flux,\nincreases with the accretion rate, and for accretion rates comparable to the\nEddington limit is close to 1. This variation stabilizes the, radiation\npressure region, so that the disk regions are secularily stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 1995 09:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
