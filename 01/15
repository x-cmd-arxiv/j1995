(1991) proposed a simple formula relating the nonlinear\nautocorrelation function of the mass distribution to the primordial spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations for gravitational clustering in an $\\Omega=1$ universe.\nHigh resolution N-body simulations show this formula to work well for\nscale-free spectra $P(k) \\propto k^n$ when the spectral index $n\\sim 0$, but\nnot when $n \\lsim -1$. We show that a modified version of the formula can work\nwell provided its form depends on $n$. This dependence can be derived from a\nsimple physical model for collapse from Gaussian initial conditions. Our\nmodified formula is easy to apply and is an excellent fit to N-body simulations\nwith $0 \\leq n \\leq -2$. It can also be applied to non-power law initial\nspectra such as that of the standard Cold Dark Matter model by using the local\nspectral index at the current nonlinear scale as the effective value of $n$ at\nany given redshift. We give analytic expressions both for the nonlinear\ncorrelation function and for the nonlinear power spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 1995 22:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 1995 21:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 1995 22:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 May 1996 22:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

A comprehensive\ncomparison is made with the behavior on the previously studied square and\ntriangular lattices. A great variety of diffusive behavior is found ranging\nfrom propagation, super-diffusion, normal, quasi-normal, anomalous to absence\nof diffusion. The influence of the scattering rules as well as of the lattice\nstructure on the diffusive behavior of a point particle moving on the all\nlattices studied so far, is summarized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 1995 18:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
