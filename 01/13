The dominant contributor to the width\ndifference is the $b\\rightarrow c\\bar c s$ transition, with final states common\nto both $B_s$ and $\\overline{B}_s$. All current experimental analyses fit the\ntime-dependences of flavor-specific $B_s$-modes to a single exponential, which\nessentially determines the average $B_s$ lifetime. We stress that the same data\nsample allows even the measurement of the width difference. To see that, this\nnote reviews the time-dependent formulae for tagged $B_s$ decays, which involve\nrapid oscillatory terms depending on $\\Delta mt$. In untagged data samples the\nrapid oscillatory terms cancel. Their time-evolutions depend only on the much\nmore slowly varying exponential falloffs. We discuss in detail the extraction\nof the two widths, and identify the large (small) CP-even (-odd) rate with that\nof the light (heavy) $B_s$ mass eigenstate. It is demonstrated that decay\nlength distributions of some \\underline{untagged} $B_s$ modes, such as $\\rho^0\nK_S, \\; D_s^{(*)\\pm}K^{(*)\\mp}$, can be used to extract the notoriously\ndifficult CKM unitarity triangle angle $\\gamma$. Sizable CP violating effects\nmay be seen with such untagged $B_s$ data samples. Listing $\\Delta\\Gamma$ as an\nobservable allows for additional important standard model constraints. Within\nthe CKM model, the ratio $\\Delta\\Gamma/ \\Delta m$ involves no CKM parameters,\nonly a QCD uncertainty. Thus a measurement of $\\Delta\\Gamma \\;(\\Delta m)$ would\npredict $\\Delta m \\;(\\Delta\\Gamma )$, up to the QCD uncertainty. A large width\ndifference would automatically solve the puzzle of the number of charmed\nhadrons per $B$ decay in favor of theory. We also derive an upper limit of $(|\n\\Delta\\Gamma | / \\Gamma)_{B_s} <~ 0.3$. Further, we must abandon the notion of\nbranching fractions of $B_s\\rightarrow f$, and instead consider $\nB(B^0_{L(H)}\\rightarrow f)$, in analogy to the neutral kaons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 1995 17:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

Starting with a formal\ndefinition of a two-state Hilbert space and basic operations, we systematically\nrecast the basics of quantum mechanics - dynamics, observables, and measurement\ntheory - in terms of two-states as the elementary quantities. We find a simple\nand suggestive formulation, that ``unifies'' two complementary observables:\nprobabilistic observables and non-probabilistic `weak' observables.\nProbabilities are relevant for measurements in the `strong coupling regime'.\nThey are given by the absolute square of a two-amplitude (a projection of a\ntwo-state). Non-probabilistic observables are observed in sufficiently `weak'\nmeasurements, and are given by linear combinations of the two-amplitude. As a\nsub-class they include the `weak values' of hermitian operators. We show that\nin the intermediate regime, one may observe a mixing of probabilities and weak\nvalues. A consequence of the suggested formalism and measurement theory, is\nthat the problem of non-locality and Lorentz non-covariance, of the usual\nprescription with a `reduction', may be eliminated. We exemplify this point for\nthe EPR experiment and for a system under successive observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 1995 03:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 1995 01:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
