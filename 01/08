It is shown that the\nRMF theory provides an unified and excellent description of the binding\nenergies, isotope shifts and deformation properties of nuclei over a large\nrange of isospin in the Z=40 region. It is observed that the RMF theory with\nthe force NL-SH is able to describe the anomalous kinks in isotope shifts in Kr\nand Sr nuclei, the problem which has hitherto remained unresolved. This is in\ncontrast with the density-dependent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach which does not\nreproduce the behaviour of the isotope shifts about shell closure. On the Zr\nchain we predict that the isotope shifts exhibit a trend similar to that of the\nKr and Sr nuclei. The RMF theory also predicts shape coexistence in heavy Sr\nisotopes. Several dramatic shape transitions in the isotopic chains are shown\nto be a general feature of nuclei in this region. A comparison of the\nproperties with the available mass models shows that the results of the RMF\ntheory are generally in accord with the predictions of the finite-range droplet\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 1995 12:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
