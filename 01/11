We propose that in SNR~1987A, ions also\nundergo diffusive acceleration at the shock, a process that is likely to be\nrapid. Unlike the electron population, the accelerated ions can have an\nimportant effect on the gas dynamics. We calculate this coupled gas and\nenergetic particle dynamics on the basis of the two-fluid model, in which the\naccelerated ions provide an additional component to the total pressure acting\non the fluid. By accelerating and possibly heating the upstream plasma, the\ninitially strong shock is modified and a weaker subshock with an upstream\nprecursor results. The electrons behave as test particles. They are accelerated\nat the evolving subshock, escape downstream, and emit synchrotron radiation in\nthe swept up magnetic field. Two models are considered for the surroundings of\nthe progenitor: that of a freely expanding wind of number density $n\\propto\nr^{-2}$, and that of a wind confined by a shell of denser material, creating a\nstagnation zone of roughly constant density beyond the standing shock which\nterminates the free wind. We model the observed radio light curves and the\nrelatively steep spectrum of SNR~1987A using similar values for the ion\nacceleration parameters to those used in models of cosmic ray acceleration in\nolder SNRs which can also contain high Mach number shocks, and find a good fit\nfor the case in which the termination shock is located at about $2\\times\n10^{15}\\,$m from the progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 1995 12:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

We show that the effect of\ndissipation, represented by a finite plasma conductivity, is to cause the\nphases to equlibrate on a time-scale, determined by the conductivity, which can\nbe much smaller than the bubble radii at the time of collision. Currents\ninduced during the phase equilibration generate a magnetic flux, which is\ndetermined by the initial phase difference. In a three-bubble collision, the\nfluxes produced by each pair of bubbles combine, and a vortex can be formed. We\nfind that, under most conditions, the probability of trapping magnetic flux to\nform a vortex is correctly given by the ``geodesic rule''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 1995 09:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-01"}

The Poisson brackets of these\n``currents\" give the simplest example of a $V$-algebra. The classical solutions\nof this model provide a free-field realization of the $V$-algebra.
