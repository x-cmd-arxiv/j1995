When a superwind interacts with halo gas, an expanding dense\nsupershell of shocked gas is formed. Using a similarity solution for the\nexpanding shell and a condition for the gravitational instability of a gaseous\nshell, we show that an expanding gaseous shell with a mass of several $10^{10}\nM_\\odot$ and a radius of several kpc becomes gravitationally unstable to form\nstars. A stellar shell is thus formed, relaxes and will evolve into a fat\nstellar system. \\par In order to investigate the fate of the stellar shell and\nits dynamical influence on the host galaxy, we performed three dimensional\n$N$-body simulations of a stellar shell plus disk system. The evolution of the\nstellar shell was computed under two types of environment: an external\nflattened potential and a live stellar disk. We find that the relaxation\nprocess and resultant structure are significantly affected by the external disk\npotential, and also depend on the velocity dispersion of the initial shell\nstars and the mass of the shell. The final galactic structure ranges from a\nthick disk and a compact bulge with a high density core to a thin disk with a\ndiffuse bulge.
