Even in the absence of the first infrared (IR)\nrenormalon, an ambiguity of order $\\Lambda^2/m_\\tau^2$ is introduced. We make a\nquantitative study of the practical implications of this ambiguity. We discuss\nthe magnitude of UV renormalon corrections obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit,\nwhich, although unrealistic, is nevertheless interesting to some extent. We\nthen study a number of improved approximants for the perturbative series, based\non a change of variable in the Borel representation, such as to displace the\nleading UV renormalon singularity at a larger distance from the origin than the\nfirst IR renormalon. The spread of the resulting values of $\\as(m^2_\\tau)$\nobtained by different approximants, at different renormalization scales, is\nexhibited as a measure of the underlying ambiguities. Finally, on the basis of\nmathematical models, we discuss the prospects of an actual improvement, given\nthe signs and magnitudes of the computed coefficients, the size of\n$\\as(m^2_\\tau)$ and what is known of the asymptotic properties of the series.\nOur conclusion is that a realistic estimate of the theoretical error cannot go\nbelow $\\delta\\as(m^2_\\tau) \\sim \\pm 0.060$, or $\\delta\\as(m^2_{\\sss Z}) \\sim\n\\pm 0.006$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 1995 11:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}
