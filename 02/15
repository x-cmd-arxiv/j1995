The kinematic measurement required is the mean\nline-of-sight velocity of all stellar light entering the slit. This quantity\ncan only be calculated reliably if any asymmetry in the shape of the broadening\nfunction of the spectral lines is also measured, and so we present a method\nwhich allows for such asymmetry. The technique also returns a true measure of\nthe RMS uncertainty in the estimate. Application of the analysis to a set of\nlong-slit spectra of NGC 936 returns four separate measures of Omega_p which\nare mutually consistent. Combining these data produces a best estimate for the\nbar pattern speed of Omega_p = 60 +/- 14 km/s/kpc (assuming a distance of 16.6\nMpc). This result refines the only previous attempt to make this measurement,\nwhich yielded an estimate for Omega_p in NGC 936 of 104 +/- 37 km/s/kpc (Kent\n1987).
