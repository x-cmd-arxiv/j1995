This method will be subsequently\nused to place constraints on cosmological parameters ($\\Omega$ and the power\nspectrum of primordial fluctuations on scales at or slightly smaller than that\nof clusters) and to test theories of cluster formation. We specifically address\nstructure that is easily discernible in projection and dynamically important to\nthe cluster. The method is derived from the two-dimensional multipole expansion\nof the projected gravitational potential and yields dimensionless {\\it power\nratios} as morphological statistics. If the projected mass profile is used to\ncharacterize the cluster morphology, the power ratios are directly related to\nthe cluster potential. However, since detailed mass profiles currently exist\nfor only a few clusters, we use the X-ray--emitting gas as an alternative\ntracer of cluster morphology. In this case, the relation of the power ratios to\nthe potential is qualitatively preserved. We demonstrate the feasibility of the\nmethod by analyzing simulated observations of simple models of X-ray clusters\nusing the instrument parameters of the ROSAT PSPC. For illustrative purposes,\nwe apply the method to ROSAT PSPC images of A85, A514, A1750, and A2029. These\nclusters, which differ substantially in their X-ray morphologies, are easily\ndistinguished by their respective power ratios. We discuss the suitability of\nthis method to address the connection between cluster morphology and cosmology\nand to assess whether an individual cluster is sufficiently relaxed for\nanalysis of its intrinsic shape using hydrostatic methods. Approximately 50\nX-ray observations of Abell clusters with the PSPC will be amenable to\nmorphological analysis using the method of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 1995 19:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 1995 15:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 1995 19:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
