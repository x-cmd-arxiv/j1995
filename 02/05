The second law\nwins, but an interesting interpretation of it emerges. This interpretation uses\nthe notion of ``encoded order'' and claims that whether a system is or is not\nin thermodynamic equilibrium depends on the coordinates which the observer\ndecides to measure. This interpretation may not be new, but most present day\nphysicists seem to be unaware of it. The question of subjectivity of entropy\nand the connection between the present interpretation and ``algorithmic\nrandomness'' are addressed.\n  Key words: Maxwell's demon, perpetuum mobile, subjectivity, entropy,\nH-theorem, randomness, complexity, information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 1995 07:10:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 1997 10:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}
