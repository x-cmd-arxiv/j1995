This important work was hoped\nto shed light onto metallic ferromagnetism from the low doping regime.\nUnfortunately, this low doping route towards ferromagnetism has not been\nsuccessful as far as rigorous results for finite doping concentrations are\nconcerned. In the work presented here, we start from the opposite limit of low\nparticle concentrations. In this limit we provide the first proof of a fully\npolarized metallic ground state for a Hubbard model. The proof proceeds by\nmapping Hubbard ``zigzag'' chains onto a continuum model with an additional\ndegree of freedom and local first Hund's rule coupling. For this model the\nmaximum total spin multiplet is shown to be the unique ground state for\ninfinite Hubbard coupling.

A new scheme based on the Higgs-Higgs\ncondensation is proposed, and it is shown that these three issues are well\nsolved by this scheme. As the first realization of this new scheme, the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Model of Higgs-Higgs Condensation (MSMHHC) is constructed and\nstudied in detail. The MSMHHC is identical with the MSSM (Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model) in the fundamental particle content, and their\nlagrangians differ only in the Higgs sector. The Higgs sector of the MSMHHC is\nbased on the softly-broken supersymmetric Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model with the\nfour-field interaction of the Higgs doublets. At low energy, these two Higgs\ndoublets condense into two neutral Higgs gauge singlets, and the low-energy\neffective lagrangian of the MSMHHC has the form of the non-minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model which contains two more Higgs singlets than the\nMSSM. Another unique feature of the MSMHHC is that heavy top quark always\nimplies strongly-interacting low-energy Higgs sector, i.e., a large mass for\nthe lightest Higgs boson.

From\nthe interplay of both frameworks a fully regularized version of the\nfield-antifield (FA) formalism arises, being able to deal with higher order\nloop corrections and to describe higher order loop contributions to the BRST\nanomaly. The quantum master equation, considered in the FA framework as the\nquantity parametrizing BRST anomalies, is argued to be incomplete at two and\nhigher order loops and conjectured to reproduce only the one-loop corrections\nto the $\\hbar^p$ anomaly generated by the addition of $O(\\hbar^{k})$, $k<p$,\ncounterterms. Chiral $W_3$ gravity is used to exemplify the nonlocally\nregularized FA formalism. First, the regularized one-loop quantum master\nequation is used to compute the complete one-loop anomaly. Its two-loop order,\nhowever, is shown to reproduce only the modification to the two-loop anomaly\nproduced by the addition of a suitable one-loop counterterm, thereby providing\nan explicit verification of the previous statement for $p=2$. The well-known\nuniversal two-loop anomaly, instead, is alternatively obtained from the BRST\nvariation of the nonlocally regulated effective action.
