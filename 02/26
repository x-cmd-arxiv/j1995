In\naddition A is a semi-topological algebra. The completion of the structure sheaf\nof an algebraic k-variety along a saturated chain of points is the prototypical\nexample of a BCA. We single out two kinds of homomorphisms between BCAs:\nmorphisms and intensifications. The first kind includes residually finite local\nhomomorphisms, whereas the second kind is a sort of localization. We prove that\nevery BCA A has a dual module K(A), and these dual modules are contravariant\nw.r.t. morphisms and covariant w.r.t. intensifications. For any\nsemi-topological A-module M we define its dual Dual_{A} M := Hom_{A}^{cont}(M,\nK(A)). This duality operation has the remarkable property of respecting\ndifferential operators: given a continuous DO D : M --> N, there is a dual DO\nDual_{A}(D) : Dual_{A} N --> Dual_{A} M. The results above are used (in a\nsubsequent paper) to construct the Grothendieck residue complex K_{X}^{.} on\nany finite type k-scheme X, and to derive many of its properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 1995 15:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

We provide a unified\ndescription which exploits the SO(8) symmetry of the bulk fermions.
