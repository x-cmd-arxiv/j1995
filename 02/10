Newly introduced dust rapidly enters the hot gas environment and is\nsputtered away by thermal collisions with ions. Before the grains are\ncompletely sputtered away, they emit prodigious amounts of infrared radiation\nwhich may contribute to the large far infrared luminosities observed in\nellipticals. In order to study the global properties of grains in ellipticals\nwe construct a new series of King-type galactic models which are consistent\nwith the fundamental plane, galactic mass to light ratios and other relevant\nobservational correlations. We describe a new ``continuity'' procedure to\nconstruct simple time-dependent gas dynamic models for cooling flows. In all\ngalaxy models, although grains can flow a considerable distance from their\nradius of origin before being sputtered away, the grain size distribution is\naccurately determined by assuming {\\it in situ} sputtering, completely ignoring\nadvection. The dominant source of grain heating is absorption of starlight;\ngrain heating by collisions with energetic thermal electrons or X-ray\nabsorption are negligible.

The most stringent bound on their\nabundance has been obtained from the absence of a detectable diffuse flux of\n100 MeV photons. Further scrutiny of these bounds is of interest as they, for\ninstance, rule out primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We here\npoint out that these bounds can, in principle, be improved by studying the\ndiffuse cosmic neutrino flux. Measurements of near-vertical atmospheric\nneutrino fluxes in a region of low geomagnetic latitude can provide a\ncompetitive bound. The most favorable energy to detect a possible diffuse flux\nof primordial black hole origin is found to be a few MeV. We also show that\nmeasurements of the diffuse $\\nu _\\tau$ flux is the most promising to improve\nthe existing bounds deduced from gamma-ray measurements. Neutrinos from\nindividual black hole explosions can be detected in the GeV-TeV energy region.\nWe find that the kilometer-scale detectors, recently proposed, are able to\nestablish competitive bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 1995 08:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}
