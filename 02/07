In principle observer\ndetects from a given astrophysical object both vapour phase and condensate\nphotons, vapour phase photons being emitted later than condensate photons.\nTherefore the erraneous identification of vapour phase photons as condensate\nphotons leads to an over estimate for the age of the star and star can look\nolder than the Universe.

On the other hand, in the Faddeev-Jackiw approach, gauge\nand reparametrization symmetries are generated by the null eigenvectors of the\nsympletic matrix and not by constraints, suggesting the possibility of dealing\nsystematically with hidden symmetries throughout this formalism. It is shown in\nthis paper that indeed hidden symmetries of noninvariant or gauge fixed systems\nare equally well described by null eigenvectors of the sympletic matrix, just\nas the explicit invariances. The Faddeev-Jackiw approach therefore provides a\nsystematic algorithm for treating all sorts of symmetries in an unified way.\nThis technique is illustrated here by the SL(2,R) affine Lie algebra of the 2-D\ninduced gravity proposed by Polyakov, which is a hidden symmetry in the\ncanonical approach of constrained systems via Dirac's method, after conformal\nand reparametrization invariances have been fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 1995 08:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 1995 03:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
