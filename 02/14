E.g.

Also we prove EP for a certain family of\nclasses of directed graphs, which implies SIP for the \"Henson digraphs\".

The parameters are determined from first-principles total-energy\ncalculations using ultra-soft pseudopotentials and a preconditioned\nconjugate-gradient scheme.

The presence of hyperons,\nparticularly the $\\Sigma^-$, shifts the threshold for $K^-$ condensation to a\nhigher density. In the mean field approach, with hyperons, the condensate\namplitude grows sufficiently rapidly that the nucleon effective mass vanishes\nat a finite density and a satisfactory treatment of the thermodynamics cannot\nbe achieved.

We show\nthat the three-dimensional approach can be obtained as the energy average of\nthe covariant formulation. We illustrate this statement in scalar and spinor\nQED. For scalar QED we derive Lorentz covariant transport and constraint\nequations directly from the Klein-Gordon equation rather than through the\npreviously used Feshbach-Villars representation. We then consider pair\nproduction in a spatially homogeneous but time-dependent electric field and\nshow that the pair density is derived much more easily via the energy averaging\nmethod than in the equal-time representation. Proceeding to spinor QED, we\nderive the covariant version of the equal-time equation derived by\nBialynicki-Birula et al. We show that it must be supplemented by another\nself-adjoint equation to obtain a complete description of the covariant spinor\nWigner operator. After spinor decomposition and energy average we study the\nclassical limit of the resulting three-dimensional kinetic equations. There are\nonly two independent spinor components in this limit, the mass density and the\nspin density, and we derive also their covariant equations of motion. We then\nshow that the equal-time kinetic equation provides a complete description only\nfor constant external electromagnetic fields, but is in general incomplete. It\nmust be supplemented by additional constraints which we derive explicitly from\nthe covariant formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 1995 14:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
