Undergeneration can be tackled either by sentence correction, or\nby grammar correction. This thesis concentrates upon automatic grammar\ncorrection (or machine learning of grammar) as a solution to the problem of\nundergeneration. Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be\nclassified as being either {\\it data-driven}, or {\\it model-based}. Data-driven\nlearners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use\ngrammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing and\ncannot guarantee that the resulting grammar is adequate for subsequent semantic\ninterpretation. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that generate\nstrings that humans would judge to be grammatically ill-formed (they {\\it\novergenerate}) and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based\nlearners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the\ncompleteness of a {\\it model of grammaticality}. But in practice, the model\nwill be incomplete. Given that in this thesis we deal with undergeneration by\nlearning, we hypothesise that the combined use of data-driven and model-based\nlearning would allow data-driven learning to compensate for model-based\nlearning's incompleteness, whilst model-based learning would compensate for\ndata-driven learning's unsoundness. We describe a system that we have used to\ntest the hypothesis empirically. The system combines data-driven and\nmodel-based learning to acquire unification-based grammars that are more\nsuitable for practical text parsing.

The\nmatrices in the image $R(SL_2(Z))$ are called the Kac-Peterson modular\nmatrices, and describe the modular behaviour of the characters. In this paper\nwe consider all levels of $(A_{r_1}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus A_{r_s})^{(1)}$, and for\neach of these find all permutations of the highest weights which commute with\nthe corresponding Kac-Peterson matrices. This problem is equivalent to the\nclassification of automorphism invariants of conformal field theories, and its\nsolution, especially considering its simplicity, is a major step toward the\nclassification of all Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 1995 00:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

These probabilities are equivalent to the ``weak measurement''\npredictions due to Aharonov {\\it et al.}, and hence describe the outcomes of\nreal measurements made on subensembles. In particular, this approach is used to\naddress the question of the history of a particle which has tunnelled across a\nbarrier. A {\\it gedankenexperiment} is presented to demonstrate the physically\ntestable implications of the results of these calculations, along with graphs\nof the time-evolution of the conditional probability distribution for a\ntunneling particle and for one undergoing allowed transmission. Numerical\nresults are also presented for the effects of loss in a bandgap medium on\ntransmission and on reflection, as a function of the position of the lossy\nregion; such loss should provide a feasible, though indirect, test of the\npresent conclusions. It is argued that the effects of loss on the pulse {\\it\ndelay time} are related to the imaginary value of the momentum of a tunneling\nparticle, and it is suggested that this might help explain a small discrepancy\nin an earlier experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 1995 22:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
