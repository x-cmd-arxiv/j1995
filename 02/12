In this approach, the envelope equations are first expressed in\nHamiltonian form. The Hamiltonian defines a nonlinear mapping, $\\cal M$, and\nfor periodic transport systems the fixed points of the one-period map are the\nmatched envelopes. Expanding the Hamiltonian around a fiducial trajectory one\nobtains a linear map, $M$, that describes trajectories (rms envelopes) near the\nfiducial trajectory. Using $\\cal M$ and $M$ we construct a contraction mapping\nthat can be used to obtain the matched envelopes. The algorithm is\nquadratically convergent. Using the zero-current matched parameters as starting\nvalues, the contraction mapping typically converges in a few to several\niterations. Since our approach uses numerical integration to obtain all the\nmappings, it includes the effects of nonidealized, $z$-dependent transverse and\nlongitudinal focusing fields. We present numerical examples including finding a\nmatched beam in a quadrupole channel with rf bunchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 1995 03:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}

We find that the\ncorresponding transverse energy levels of two parallel wires lock together when\nthe wires' widths are similar and their separation is not too small. This\nenergy level locking is an effect of Coulomb interactions and of the the\ndensity of states singularities that are characteristic of quasi-\none-dimensional Fermionic systems. In dissimilar parallel wires level lockings\nare much less likely to occur. Energy level locking in similar wires persists\nto quite large wire separations, but is gradually suppressed by inter-wire\ntunneling when the separation becomes small. Experimental implications of these\ntheoretical results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 1995 07:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 1995 02:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 1995 01:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
