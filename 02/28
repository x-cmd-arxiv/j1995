Our first main result is the classification of all\nstrongly-modular fusion algebras of dimension two, three and four and the\nclassification of all nondegenerate strongly-modular fusion algebras of\ndimension less than 24. Secondly, we show that the conformal characters of\nvarious rational models of W-algebras can be determined from the mere knowledge\nof the central charge and the set of conformal dimensions. We also describe how\nto actually construct conformal characters by using theta series associated to\ncertain lattices. On our way we develop several tools for studying\nrepresentations of the modular group on spaces of modular functions.

Here, we\npresent an explicit construction of all the generators of this cohomology for\nany coset space $G/H$ and compact, connected group $G$. Generators contributing\nto actions in 4-dimensional space-time arise either as products of generators\nof lower degree such as the Goldstone-Wilczek current, or are of the\nWess-Zumino-Witten type. The latter arise if and only if $G$ has a non-zero\n$G$-invariant symmetric $d$-symbol, which vanishes when restricted to the\nsubgroup $H$, i.e. when $G$ has anomalous representations in which $H$ is\nembedded in an anomaly free way. Coupling of additional gauge fields leads to\nactions whose gauge variation coincides with the chiral anomaly, which is\ncarried here by Goldstone boson fields at tree level. Generators contributing\nto actions in 3-dimensional space-time arise as Chern-Simons terms evaluated on\nconnections that are composites of the Goldstone field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 1995 02:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
