Even in $d=1$ the finite curvature of the energy dispersion at\nthe Fermi surface gives rise to interactions between the bosons. In higher\ndimensions scattering processes describing momentum transfer between different\npatches on the Fermi surface (around-the-corner processes) are an additional\nsource for corrections to the Gaussian approximation. We derive an explicit\nexpression for the leading correction to the bosonized Hamiltonian and the\nirreducible self-energy of the bosonic propagator that takes the finite\ncurvature as well as around-the-corner processes into account. In the special\ncase that around-the-corner scattering is negligible, we show that the\nself-energy correction to the Gaussian propagator is negligible if the\ndimensionless quantities $ ( \\frac{q_{c} }{ k_{F}} )^d F_{0} [ 1 + F_{0} ]^{-1}\n\\frac{\\mu}{\\nu^{\\alpha}} | \\frac{ \\partial \\nu^{\\alpha} }{ \\partial \\mu} |$ are\nsmall compared with unity for all patches $\\alpha$.

In the Batalin-Fradkin (BF) formalism, the anomaly-canceling\nsuper-Liouville fields are introduced to identify the original second-class\nconstrained system with a gauge-fixed version of a first-class system. The\nBFV-BRST quantization applies to formulate the theory in the most general class\nof gauges. A local effective action constructed in the configuration space\ncontains two super-Liouville actions; one is a noncovariant but local\nfunctional written only in terms of 2D supergravity fields, and the other\ncontains the super-Liouville fields canceling the super-Weyl anomaly. Auxiliary\nfields for the Liouville and the gravity super-multiplets are introduced to\nmake the BRST algebra close off-shell.
