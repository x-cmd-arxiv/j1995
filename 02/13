It may lead to many important consequences. We will\nargue, in particular, that nonperturbative gravitational effects in the axion\ntheory lead to a strong violation of CP invariance unless they are suppressed\nby an extremely small factor 10^{-82}. One could hope that this problem\ndisappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion field\nas a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric\ntensor field. We will show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protect\nthe axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effects\nviolating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e^{-S}, where S is\nthe action of a wormhole which may eat the global charge. Unfortunately, in a\nwide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of gravity the action\nappears to be fairly small, S = O(10). However, we have found that the\nexistence of wormholes and the value of their action are extremely sensitive to\nthe structure of space on the nearly Planckian scale. We consider several\nexamples (Kaluza-Klein theory, conformal anomaly, R^2 terms) which show that\nmodifications of the Einstein theory on the length scale l ~ 10 M_P^{-1} may\nstrongly suppress violation of global symmetries. We have found also that in\nstring theory there exists an additional suppression of topology change by the\nfactor e^{-{8\\pi^2\\over g^2}}. This effect is strong enough to save the axion\ntheory for the natural values of the stringy gauge coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 1995 22:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 1995 21:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
