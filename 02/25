Our data show no evidence for evolution of the $K$-band\nluminosity function at $z<0.5$, and the results are well described by a\nSchechter function with $M_K^*=-22.75\\pm0.13+5\\log_{10}h$ and\n$\\phi^*=0.026\\pm0.003 h^3 {\\rm Mpc^{-3}}$. This is a somewhat higher\nnormalization than has been found by previous workers, and it removes much of\nthe excess in faint $K$ and $B$ counts with respect to a no-evolution model.\nHowever, we do find evidence for evolution at $z>0.5$: $M_K^*$ is approximately\n0.75 mag. brighter at $z=1$. This luminosity evolution is balanced by a reduced\nnormalization at high redshift. The overall evolution is thus opposite to that\nexpected in simple merger-dominated models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 1995 16:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 1995 17:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
