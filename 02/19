This paper reviews these basic models for\nforest clouds, considering spherical and slab geometries. At high redshift, the\nclouds are still likely to be in the process of formation, and it seems\nessential to consider them as dynamic structures in a cosmological context. At\nlow redshift, observations of large cloud sizes (indicated by their covering of\nboth lines of sight toward quasar pairs) have recently reshaped our view of the\nforest. Galaxy-like disks/slabs, which would be gravity confined near the\ncenter, but pressure confined in their outer regions (extending out to hundreds\nof kpcs), may be responsible for the low z forest. The ultimate view of the\nidentity of the forest clouds and their relationship to galaxies is likely to\ninvolve a synthesis of many of the models discussed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 1995 03:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Thus all the known exact solutions of general relativity\nwith axial symmetry (e.g. the Kerr metric, the Tomimatsu-Sato metric) have\nYang-Mills equivalents. In this paper we only examine in detail the Kerr-like\nsolution. It will be seen that this solution has surfaces where the gauge and\nscalar fields become infinite, which correspond to the infinite redshift\nsurfaces of the normal Kerr solution. It is speculated that this feature may be\nconnected with the confinement mechanism since any particle which carries an\nSU(2) color charge would tend to become trapped once it passes these surfaces.\nUnlike the Kerr solution, our solution apparently does not have any intrinsic\nangular momentum, but rather appears to give the non-Abelian field\nconfiguration associated with concentric shells of color charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 1995 00:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
