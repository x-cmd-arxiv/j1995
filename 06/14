A ``maximum reasonable rate''\nmodel for merging finds a $\\sim2$ mag K band increase in the luminosities of\ndwarf galaxies so that they contribute significantly to the faint counts, with\nspirals and ellipticals being far less affected. The median $K$ and $I$\nredshifts stabilize (and even decrease slightly) at $z\\simeq0.6$ beyond I=21 or\nK=19. The B redshifts continue to rise (although strongly dependent on the UV\nspectral evolution). Such rapid merging predicts that at $z=1$ the\ncharacteristic galaxy mass is reduced to $\\sim30\\%$ of the $z=0$ value. To rule\nout this model requires good sampling beyond $z=1$.\n  A theoretical complication for even a minimal merger rate, which reduces\n$z=1$ masses to 2/3 of current epoch values, is that infall of a single\nsatellite having 10\\% of a disk's mass may destroy thin disks.

The calculations are carried out using the\nB-spline method for the Dirac equation.\n  For low $Z$ the results of the calculation are in good agreement with the\n$\\alpha Z$ -expansion results. It is found that the nuclear recoil\ncontribution, additional to the Salpeter's one, to the Lamb shift ($n=2$) of\nhydrogen is $-1.32(6)\\,kHz$. The total nuclear recoil correction to the energy\nof the $(1s)^{2}2p_{\\frac{1}{2}}-(1s)^{2}2s$ transition in lithium-like uranium\nconstitutes $-0.07\\,eV$ and is largely made up of QED contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 1995 15:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
