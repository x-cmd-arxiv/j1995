This\nevidence, by and large, probes the expansion of the Universe within 100 Mpc. We\ninvestigate the possibility that the expansion rate within this region is\nsystematically higher than the true expansion rate due to the presence of a\nlocal, large underdense region or void. We begin by calculating the expected\ndeviations between the locally measured Hubble constant and the true Hubble\nconstant for a variety of models. We also discuss the expected correlations\nbetween these deviations and mass fluctuation for the sample volume. We find\nthat the fluctuations are small for the standard cold dark matter as well as\nmixed dark matter models but can be substantial in a number of interesting and\nviable nonstandard scenarios. However, deviations in the Hubble flow for a\nregion of radius 200 Mpc are small for virtually all reasonable models.\nTherefore, methods based on supernovae or the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which\ncan probe 200 Mpc scales, will be essential in determining the true Hubble\nconstant. We discuss, in detail, the fluctuations induced in the cosmic\nbackground radiation by voids at the last scattering surface. In addition, we\ndiscuss the dipole and quadrupole fluctuations one would expect if the void\nenclosing us is aspherical or if we lie off-center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 1995 14:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

An analytic\nresult to order $g^4,\\lambda^2$ is presented for the Abelian Higgs model, the\nSU(2)-Higgs model and the standard model and a complete on-shell\nrenormalization at zero temperature is performed. Higher order corrections are\nfound to increase the strength of the first order phase transition in the\nnon-Abelian model, opposite to the Abelian case. This effect is traced back to\nthe infrared contributions from the typical non-Abelian diagrams. The\ndependence of several phase transition parameters on the Higgs mass is analysed\nin detail. A new, gauge invariant, approach based on the composite field\n$\\Phi^\\dagger\\Phi$ is introduced. This method, which supports the above Landau\ngauge results numerically, permits a conceptually simpler treatment of the\nthermodynamics of the phase transition. In particular, it enables a\nstraightforward comparison with lattice data and the application of the\nClausius-Clapeyron equation to the electroweak phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 1995 10:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
