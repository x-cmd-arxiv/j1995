These images reach $R\\sim27$ in median seeing FWHM $\\sim 0.5$--0.6\narcsec and we detect a integrated galaxy number density of $7\\times 10^{5}$\ndegree$^{-2}$, equivalent to $3\\times 10^{10}$ galaxies in the observable\nUniverse. In addition we present median galaxy colors as a function of\nmagnitude; bluing trends are visible in all colors to $R\\sim 24.5$. Fainter\nthan $R\\sim24.5$, however, the typical \\VR\\ color becomes redder again, \\VI\\\nremains constant, and \\RI\\ becomes yet bluer. These trends are consistent with\nthe $VRI$ count slopes, implying a decrease in the $V$ slope at the faintest\nlevels, which our data supports. Taking advantage of our good seeing we also\npresent median half-light radii for faint galaxies, these show a steady decline\nat fainter magnitudes, leading to an intrinsic half-light radius of $\\sim 0.2$\narcsec for a typical $R\\sim25.5$--26 galaxy. Irrespective of the redshift\ndistribution, the extremely high galaxy surface densities and their small\nintrinsic sizes are consistent with a scenario in which the majority of the\nvery faint field population are dwarf galaxies or sub-galactic units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 1995 20:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
