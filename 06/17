The amplitude of the low redshift ($z<0.3$) QSO-galaxy angular\ncross-correlation function is identical to that of the APM galaxy angular\ncorrelation function, implying that these (predominantly radio-quiet) QSOs\ninhabit environments similar to those of normal galaxies. No significant galaxy\nexcess was found around a `control' sample of $z>0.3$ QSOs. Coupled with\nprevious observations, these results imply that the environment of radio-quiet\nQSOs undergoes little evolution over a wide range in redshift ($0 less than z\nless than 1.5$). This is in marked contrast to the rapid increase in the\nrichness of the environments associated with radio-loud QSOs over the same\nredshift range. The similarity between QSO-galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy\nclustering also suggests that QSOs are unbiased with respect to galaxies and\nmake useful tracers of large-scale structure in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 1995 16:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
