We consider the\ndifferent ground state modes $\\pi \\pi$, $\\pi \\rho$, $\\rho \\rho$, and, assuming\nthe FSI phases to be negligible, we investigate the amount of uncertainty\ncoming from Penguins that can be parametrized by a dilution factor $D$ and an\nangle shift $\\Delta \\alpha$. The parameter $D$ is either 1 or very close to 1\nin all these modes, and it can be measured independently, up to a sign\nambiguity, by the $t$ dependence. Assuming factorization, we show that $\\Delta\n\\alpha$ is much smaller for the modes $\\rho \\pi$ and $\\rho \\rho$ than for $\\pi\n\\pi$, and we plot their allowed region as a function of $\\alpha$ itself.\nMoreover, we show that most of the modes contribute to the asymmetry with the\nsame sign, and define for their sum an effective $D_{eff}$ and an effective\n$\\Delta \\alpha_{eff}$, an average of $\\Delta \\alpha$ for the different modes.\nIt turns out that $D_{eff}$ is of the order of 0.9, $\\Delta \\alpha_{eff}$ is\nbetween 5 $\\%$ and 10 $\\%$ and, relative to $\\pi \\pi$, the statistical gain for\nthe sum is of about a factor 10. Finally, we compute the ratios $K\\pi /\\pi \\pi\n, \\cdots$ that test the strength of the Penguins and depend on the CP angles,\nas emphasized by Silva and Wolfenstein and by Deandrea et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 1995 18:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We show that after the initial\ncycle of collapse and fractional/full revivals, which occurs on the time scale\n$t_{\\rm rev}$, a new sequence of revivals begins. We find that the structure of\nthe new revivals is different from that of the fractional revivals. The new\nrevivals are characterized by periodicities in the motion of the wave packet\nwith periods that are fractions of the revival time scale $t_{\\rm rev}$. These\nlong-term periodicities result in the autocorrelation function at times greater\nthan $t_{\\rm rev}$ having a self-similar resemblance to its structure for times\nless than $t_{\\rm rev}$. The new sequence of revivals culminates with the\nformation of a single wave packet that more closely resembles the initial wave\npacket than does the full revival at time $t_{\\rm rev}$, i.e., a superrevival\nforms. Explicit examples of the superrevival structure for both circular and\nradial wave packets are given. We then study wave packets in alkali-metal\natoms, which are typically used in experiments. The behavior of these packets\nis affected by the presence of quantum defects that modify the hydrogenic\nrevival time scales and periodicities. Their behavior can be treated\nanalytically using supersymmetry-based quantum-defect theory. We illustrate our\nresults for alkali-metal atoms with explicit examples of the revival structure\nfor radial wave packets in rubidium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 1995 16:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Sets of these perceptions can be deterministically\nrealized with measures given by expectation values of positive-operator-valued\nawareness operators in a quantum state of the universe which never jumps or\ncollapses. Ratios of the measures for these sets of perceptions can be\ninterpreted as frequency-type probabilities for many actually existing sets\nrather than as propensities for potentialities to be actualized, so there is\nnothing indeterministic in SQM. These frequency-type probabilities generally\ncannot be given by the ordinary quantum \"probabilities\" for a single set of\nalternatives. Probabilism, or ascribing probabilities to unconscious aspects of\nthe world, may be seen to be an aesthemamorphic myth.\n  No fundamental correlation or equivalence is postulated between different\nperceptions (each being the entirety of a single conscious experience and thus\nnot in direct contact with any other), so SQM, a variant of Everett's\n\"many-worlds\" framework, is a \"many-perceptions\" framework but not a\n\"many-minds\" framework. Different detailed SQM theories may be tested against\nexperienced perceptions by the typicalities (defined herein) they predict for\nthese perceptions. One may adopt the Conditional Aesthemic Principle: among the\nset of all conscious perceptions, our perceptions are likely to be typical.\n  An experimental test is proposed to compare SQM with a variant, SQMn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 1995 23:50:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 1997 05:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
