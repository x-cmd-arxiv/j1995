Specifically, the globular cluster systems used in distance\nscale studies have traditionally been those around elliptical galaxies. These\nsystems have higher mean metallicities than the Milky Way globular cluster\nsystem. Consequently, the peak of the GCLF in the systems around ellipticals is\nsignificantly fainter in $B$ and $V$ than the GCLF peak in the Milky Way. We\ncalculate the shift in the peak of the GCLF relative to the Milky Way globulars\nin $B$, $V$, $R$, $I$ and $J$ for a range of globular cluster metallicities.\nApplying these corrections, we find good agreement between GCLF distances and\nthose obtained using the surface brightness fluctuations method. The similarity\nbetween metallicity-corrected GCLFs suggests that the underlying mass function\nof globular cluster systems is remarkably constant from one galaxy to another.\nOur results allow the GCLF to be employed as an improved distance indicator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 1995 19:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The\nlatter ten-dimensional solutions can be compactified to supersymmetric\nmonopole, string and domain wall solutions which break $1/2$ of the spacetime\nsupersymmetries of $N=4, D=4$ heterotic string theory, and which can be\ngeneralized to two-parameter charged black hole solutions. The low-energy\ndynamics of these solutions is also discussed, as well as their connections\nwith strong/weak coupling duality and target space duality in string theory.\nFinally, new solutions are presented which break $3/4, 7/8$ and all of the\nspacetime supersymmetries and which also arise in more realistic $N=1$ and\n$N=2$ compactifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 1995 19:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

We consider the\nsuggestion, due to Susskind and Uglum, that these divergences are proportional,\nand attempt to clarify its precise meaning. Using a Euclidean formulation the\nproportionality is a fairly immediate consequence of basic principles -- a\nlow-energy theorem. Thus in this framework renormalizing the Newton constant\nrenders the entropy finite, and equal to its semiclassical value. As a partial\ncheck on our formal arguments we compare the one loop determinants, calculated\nusing heat kernel regularization. An alternative definition of black hole\nentropy relates it to behavior at conical singularities in two dimensions, and\nthus to a suitable definition of geometric entropy. Geometric entropy permits\nthe same renormalization, but it does not yield an intrinsically positive\nquantity. For scalar fields geometric entropy is subtly sensitive to curved\nspace couplings, even in the limit of flat space. Fermions and gauge fields are\nconsidered as well. Their functional determinants are closely related to the\ndeterminants for non-minimally coupled scalar fields with specific values for\nthe curvature coupling, and pose no further difficulties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 1995 20:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
