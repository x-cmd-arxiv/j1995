However, the values for $t'$ discussed\nin the literature were obtained comparing theoretical results in the weak\ncoupling limit with experimental photoemission data and band structure\ncalculations. The goal of this paper is to study how $t'$ gets renormalized as\nthe interaction between electrons, $U$, increases. For this purpose, the effect\nof adding a bare diagonal hopping $t'$ to the fully interacting two dimensional\nHubbard model Hamiltonian is investigated using numerical techniques.

An\nalternative truncation scheme which may be more appropriate for black hole\nphysics is proposed and analyzed. In both schemes the thermal Hawking radiation\nremains unaffected even though transplanckian energies no longer appear. The\nuniversality of this result is explained by working in momentum space. In that\nrepresentation, in the presence of a horizon, the d'Alembertian equation\nbecomes a singular first order equation. In addition, the boundary conditions\ncorresponding to vacuum before the black hole formed are that the in--modes\ncontain positive momenta only.
