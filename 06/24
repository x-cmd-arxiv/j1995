One of its most important\nfeatures is its large symmetry group, which contains the conformal\ntransformations in two dimensions as a subgroup. At quantum level, the symmetry\ngroup of a theory gives rise to differential equations between correlation\nfunctions of observables. We show that these Ward-identities are equivalent to\nOperator Product Expansions (OPEs), which encode the short-distance\nsingularities of correlation functions with symmetry generators. The OPEs allow\nus to determine algebraically many properties of the theory under study. We\nanalyse the calculational rules for OPEs, give an algorithm to compute OPEs,\nand discuss an implementation in Mathematica. There exist different string\ntheories, based on extensions of the conformal algebra to so-called W-algebras.\nThese algebras are generically nonlinear. We study their OPEs, with as main\nresults an efficient algorithm to compute the beta-coefficients in the OPEs,\nthe first explicit construction of the WB_2-algebra, and criteria for the\nfactorisation of free fields in a W-algebra. An important technique to\nconstruct realisations of W-algebras is Drinfel'd- Sokolov reduction. The\nmethod consists of imposing certain constraints on the elements of an affine\nLie algebra. We quantise this reduction via gauged WZNW-models. This enables us\nin a theory with a gauged W-symmetry, to compute exactly the correlation\nfunctions of the effective theory.

It is found that s-wave rescattering contribution\nis much smaller than the contribution coming from projectile $\\Delta$\nexcitation mechanism. The addition of s-wave rescattering contribution to the\ndominant part, however, improves the fit to the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 1995 19:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Then the stability of finite size strangelets is studied minimizing the\nfree energy as a function of the radius of the bag. The colour-singlet\nrestriction has several profound effects when compared to colour unprojected\ncase: (1) Now bulk energy per baryon is increased by about $250$ MeV making the\nstrange quark matter unbound. (2) The shell structures are more pronounced\n(deeper). (3) Positions of the shell closure are shifted to lower $A$-values,\nthe first deepest one occuring at $A=2$, famous $H$-particle ! (4) The shell\nstructure at $A=2$ vanishes only at $T\\sim 30$ MeV, though for higher\n$A$-values it happens so at $T\\sim 20$ MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 1995 19:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
