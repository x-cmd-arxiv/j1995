This evidence has\nled to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the \"best\" possible\nplanning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment\nplanners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in\nparticular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of\ntrying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner\nthat can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which\nplanning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm,\nFLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step\norderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to\neager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering\ncommitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using\na simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can\nvary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also\nduring the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel\ncontribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which\ncommitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to\ninvestigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient\nplanning strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
