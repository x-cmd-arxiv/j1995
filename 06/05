In this paper, we identify physically tenable sources of\nacoustic and electromagnetic radiations the amplitudes of whose emissions to\nparticular distant zones decay cylindrically (like {R_P}^{-{1\\over2}}) rather\nthan spherically (like {R_P}^{-1}) as R_P tends to infinity (R_P denotes the\ndistance of the observer from the source). These sources have moving\ndistribution patterns which are in general three-dimensional and which\npropagate faster than the emitted waves. Their emission is characterized by a\nwaveform of constant duration that consists of a continuous assemblage of\ncylindrically decaying subpulses. Each subpulse embodies a propagating caustic\nand is narrower the further away it is observed from the source. The change in\nthe lifetime of the subpulses with range (\\sim {R_P}^{-1}) is such that their\nenergy---but not their intensity---follows the inverse square law and the\nRayleigh distance associated with them is of the same order of magnitude as\ntheir distance from the source (R_P) for all values of this distance.\\par We\npresent our work in the context of the literature on the non-diffracting wave\npackets known as acoustic or electromagnetic missiles, and point out how these\nmissiles allow the existing body of data on the emissions from supersonic jets\nand propellers and from pulsars to be seen in a different light.

We first show analytically and\nnumerically that there is a finite critical value of the background density,\nbelow which the front associated with the temperature field stops propagating.\nThe critical exponents associated with this transition are shown to be\nconsistent with mean field theory of percolation. Second, we study the kinetic\nroughening associated with a moving planar flame front above the critical\ndensity. By numerically calculating the time dependent width and equal time\nheight correlation function of the front, we demonstrate that the roughening\nprocess belongs to the universality class of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interface\nequation.
