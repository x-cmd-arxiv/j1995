For\n$B\\ga4\\times10^8\\rm\\,T$, the curvature $\\gamma$-quanta emitted tangentially to\nthe curved force lines of the magnetic field are captured near the threshold of\nbound pair creation and are channelled along the magnetic field as bound\nelectron-positron pairs (positronium). The stability of such bound pairs\nagainst ionization by the parallel electric field, $E_\\parallel$, in the polar\ncap, and against photoionization is discussed. Unlike free pairs, bound pairs\ndo not screen $E_\\parallel$ near the neutron star. As a consequence, the energy\nflux in highly relativistic particles and high-frequency (X-ray and/or\n$\\gamma$-ray) radiation from the polar gaps can be much greater than in the\nabsence of positronium formation. We discuss this enhancement for (a)\nArons-type models, in which particles flow freely from the surface, and find\nany enhancement to be modest, and (b) Ruderman-Sutherland-type models, in which\nparticles are tightly bound to the surface, and find that the enhancement can\nbe substantial.

This model applies only in a restricted range of periods,\n$P_2<P<P_1$, and it implies an energy flux in high-energy particles that can\ncorrespond to a substantial fraction of the spin-down power of the pulsar.\n  Nonthermal, high-frequency radiation has been observed from six radio pulsars\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 1995 06:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
