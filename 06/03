The quantum groups and tangle\nfunctor formalisms for understanding these invariants and their descendents are\ngiven. The quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$, which gives rise to the Jones polynomial,\nis constructed explicitly. The $3$-manifold invariants and the axiomatic\ntopological quantum field theories which arise from these link invariants at\ncertain values of the parameter are constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 1995 21:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 1995 18:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
