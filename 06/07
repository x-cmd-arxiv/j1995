For\nmacroscopic reflectors, the quantum noise on positions is dominated by\ngravitational vacuum fluctuations, and takes a universal form deduced from\nquantum fluctuations of space-time curvatures in vacuum. These can be\nconsidered as ultimate space-time fluctuations, fixing ultimate quantum limits\nin space-time measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 1995 15:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
