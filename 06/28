The 2PN approximation of these\n\"tensor-multi-scalar\" theories is obtained thanks to a diagrammatic expansion\nwhich allows us to compute the Lagrangian describing the motion of N bodies. In\ncontrast with previous studies which had to introduce many phenomenological\nparameters, we find that the 2PN deviations from general relativity can be\nfully described by only two new 2PN parameters, epsilon and zeta, beyond the\nusual (Eddington) 1PN parameters beta and gamma. It follows from the basic\ntenets of field theory, notably the absence of negative-energy excitations,\nthat (beta-1), epsilon and zeta (as well as any new parameter entering higher\npost-Newtonian orders) must tend to zero with (gamma-1). It is also found that\nepsilon and zeta do not enter the 2PN equations of motion of light. Therefore,\nlight-deflection or time-delay experiments cannot probe any theoretically\nmotivated 2PN deviation from general relativity, but they can give a clean\naccess to (gamma-1), which is of greatest significance as it measures the basic\ncoupling strength of matter to the scalar fields.
