The Coma cluster relation has \\~1.5 times\nlower scatter at K than in B or V. Excluding 4 outliers, the RMS scatter at K\nfor 24 galaxies in Coma is only 4.8% in distance, close to the limit implied by\nthe observational errors. Distance estimates based on the IR \\Dsig relation\nwill be more accurate than those derived from optical data. The improvement in\nthe infrared is attributed to a decrease in sensitivity to stellar population\nparameters (age, metallicity, and slope of the IMF) as well as lower internal\nextinction from dust compared to the optical. That the \\Dsig relation has a\nlarger scatter in the optical indicates that there are detectable, but small,\nstellar population or dust content differences among the Coma ellipticals.\nSince the \\Dsig relations are based on the fundamental plane, this result\npromises that the fundamental plane is thinner in the infrared than it is in\nthe optical.\n  Infrared photometric data available for Virgo are limited to just 13 objects;\nthe spread in distance due to the depth of the cluster precludes any\nsignificant improvement over B and V. A relative Coma-Virgo distance of 5.56 is\nderived from the K band data, in agreement with estimates in other colors and\nusing other techniques, indicating that there is no significant age difference\nbetween Virgo and Coma ellipticals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 1995 17:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
