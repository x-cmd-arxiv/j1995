This paper describes recent progress in the corresponding\nanalysis of quantum amplitudes for Euclidean Maxwell theory and linearized\ngravity. Within the framework of Faddeev-Popov formalism and zeta-function\nregularization, various choices of mixed boundary conditions lead to a deeper\nunderstanding of quantized gauge fields and quantum gravity in the presence of\nboundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 1995 14:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These tend to arrange in a triangular flux-line lattice (FLL) which\nis more or less perturbed by material inhomogeneities that pin the flux lines,\nand in high-$T_c$ supercon- ductors (HTSC's) also by thermal fluctuations. Many\nproperties of the FLL are well described by the phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau theory or by the electromagnetic London theory, which treats\nthe vortex core as a singularity. In Nb alloys and HTSC's the FLL is very soft\nmainly because of the large magnetic penetration depth: The shear modulus of\nthe FLL is thus small and the tilt modulus is dispersive and becomes very small\nfor short distortion wavelength. This softness of the FLL is enhanced further\nby the pronounced anisotropy and layered structure of HTSC's, which strongly\nincreases the penetration depth for currents along the c-axis of these uniaxial\ncrystals and may even cause a decoupling of two-dimensional vortex lattices in\nthe Cu-O layers. Thermal fluctuations and softening may melt the FLL and cause\nthermally activated depinning of the flux lines or of the 2D pancake vortices\nin the layers. Various phase transitions are predicted for the FLL in layered\nHTSC's. The linear and nonlinear magnetic response of HTSC's gives rise to\ninteresting effects which strongly depend on the geometry of the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 1995 12:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
