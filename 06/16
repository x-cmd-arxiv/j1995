Applying the\nhydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry assumptions and using these data\ntogether with the Ginga spectral and the Rosat imaging data, we were able to\nseverely limit the possible binding mass distribution of the generic form\nrho=rho_0 (1+r^2/a_b^2)^{-n/2}.

We find it useful to\nintroduce the concept of a ``blended Einstein radius\" and an ``effective\nEinstein radius\", to describe the probability that a mass will serve as a lens,\nor that a source will be lensed in an observable way. These considerations lead\nto generic predictions about the results of gravitational microlensing\nexperiments. One example is that the optical depth for the lensing of giants is\ngreater than that for the lensing of main sequence stars; for any given\npopulation of sources and lenses this effect can be quantified.

From this point of view\nthe usual $D$-flatness conditions are an artifact of Wess--Zumino gauge. By\nusing a gauge that preserves $\\Gc$ invariance we show that every constant\nmatter field configuration that extremizes the superpotential is $\\Gc$\ngauge-equivalent (in a sense that we make precise) to a unique classical\nvacuum. This result is used to prove that in the absence of a superpotential\nthe classical moduli space is the algebraic variety described by the set of all\nholomorphic gauge-invariant polynomials. When a superpotential is present, we\nshow that the classical moduli space is a variety defined by imposing\nadditional relations on the holomorphic polynomials. Many of these points are\nalready contained in the existing literature. The main contribution of the\npresent work is that we give a careful and self-contained treatment of limit\npoints and singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 1995 20:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In a stationary\ndielectric the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field excite\nvirtual two-photon states which become real under perturbation due to motion of\nthe dielectric. The sonoluminescent bubble is modelled as an optically empty\ncavity in a homogeneous dielectric. The problem of the photon emission by a\ncavity of time-dependent radius is handled in a Hamiltonian formalism which is\ndealt with perturbatively up to first order in the velocity of the bubble\nsurface over the speed of light. A parameter-dependence of the zero-order\nHamiltonian in addition to the first-order perturbation calls for a new\nperturbative method combining standard perturbation theory with an adiabatic\napproximation.
