The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is the nearest galaxy known, subtends\nan angle of $> 10$ degrees on the sky, lies at a distance of $24 \\kpc$ from the\nSun, $\\sim 16 \\kpc$ from the centre of the Milky Way. Itis comparable in size\nand luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, has a well populated red\nhorizontal branch with a blue HB extension; a substantial carbon star\npopulation; and a strong intermediate age stellar component with evidence of a\nmetallicity spread. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly elongated along a\ndirection pointing towards the Galactic centre and suggest that it has been\ntidally distorted. The close proximity to the Galactic centre, the\nmorphological appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km/s indicate that this\nsystem must have undergone at most very few close orbital encounters with the\nMilky Way. It is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being\nintegrated into the Galaxy. Probably all of the four globular clusters, M54,\nArp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and\nwill probably share the fate of their progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 1995 16:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
