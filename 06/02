A crucial\naspect of this process is whether the gas cools as fast as it falls into the\ngravitational potential well. If it does then rapid normal star formation is\nassumed to ensue. If not, and the gas can still cool by the present time, then\nthe situation resembles that of a cooling flow, such as commonly found in\nclusters of galaxies. The cooled matter is assumed to accumulate as very cold\nclouds and/or low mass stars, i.e. as baryonic dark matter. In this paper we\ninvestigate the likelihood of a cooling flow phase during the hierarchical\nformation of galaxies. We concentrate on the behaviour of the gas, using a\nhighly simplified treatment of the evolution of the dark matter potential\nwithin which the gas evolves. We assume that normal star formation is limited\nby how much gas the associated supernovae can unbind and allow the gas profile\nto flatten as a consequence of supernova energy injection. We find that cooling\nflows are an important phase in the formation of most galaxies with total (dark\nplus luminous) masses approxgt 10^12 Msun , creating about 20 per cent of the\ntotal dark halo in a galaxy such as our own and a smaller but comparable\nfraction of an elliptical galaxy of similar mass. The onset of a cooling flow\ndetermines the upper mass limit for the formation of a visible spheroid from\ngas, setting a characteristic mass scale for normal galaxies. We argue that\ndisk formation requires a cooling flow phase and that dissipation in the\ncooling flow phase is the most important factor in the survival of normal\ngalaxies during subsequent hierarchical mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 1995 13:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
