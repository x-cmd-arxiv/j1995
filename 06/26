This leads to a semiclassical analysis\nof quantum amplitudes, involving transverse modes, ghost modes, coupled normal\nand longitudinal modes, and the decoupled normal mode of Maxwell theory. On\nimposing magnetic or electric boundary conditions, flat Euclidean space bounded\nby two concentric 3-spheres is found to give rise to gauge-invariant one-loop\namplitudes, at least in the cases considered so far. However, when flat\nEuclidean 4-space is bounded by only one 3-sphere, one-loop amplitudes are\ngauge-dependent, and the agreement with the covariant formalism is only\nachieved on studying the Lorentz gauge. Moreover, the effects of gauge modes\nand ghost modes do not cancel each other exactly for problems with boundaries.\nRemarkably, when combined with the contribution of physical (i.e. transverse)\ndegrees of freedom, this lack of cancellation is exactly what one needs to\nachieve agreement with the results of the Schwinger-DeWitt technique.

Developing an asymptotic method to investigate the long time behavior\nnear a critical point, we derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation\nas the lowest order model. There are an infinite number of kink solitons to the\nmKdV equation, while it has been found by numerical simulations that the kink\npattern arising in traffic congestion is uniquely determined irrespective of\ninitial conditions. In order to resolve this selection problem, we consider\nhigher order corrections to the mKdV equation and find that there is a kink\nsoliton which can deform continuously with the perturbation represented by the\naddition of these corrections. With numerical confirmation, we show that this\ncontinuously deformable kink soliton characterizes traffic congestion. We also\ndiscuss the relationship between traffic congestion and slugging phenomenon in\ngranular flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 1995 06:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Among the published discussions\nabout this kind of effects, it is generally agreed that this kind of effects\ndoes not exist due to gauge invariance. However, there are also opinions that\nthis effect is a trivial variation of Aharonov-Bohm effect and therefore there\nis no need to check its existence. To my knowledge, it has never been tested.\nMy first goal here is to supply enough theoretical reason to motivate the\nexperimental test of this effect. I start with an intuitive derivation, then I\nintroduce a wave-front theory as a theoretical consideration. Logically, the\nexistence of potential effect implies the existence of the AB effect, but not\nvice versa.
