Calculations are performed using\nrelativistic mean field models, in which both the baryon-baryon and kaon-baryon\ninteractions are mediated by meson exchange. Results of kaon condensation are\nfound to be qualitatively similar to previous work with chiral models, if\ncompatibility of the kaon optical potentials is required. The presence of\nstrangeness, be it in the form of hyperons or kaons, implies a reduction in the\nmaximum mass and a relatively large number of protons, sufficient to allow\nrapid cooling to take place. The need to improve upon the poorly-known\ncouplings of the strange particles, which determine the composition and\nstructure of neutron stars, is stressed. We also discuss generic problems with\neffective masses in mean field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 1995 18:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
