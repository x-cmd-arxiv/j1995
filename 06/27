Working in the Schroedinger picture of quantum field\ntheory, we confirm that the phenomenon of parametric resonance in the classical\ntheory implies an instability of quantum vacuum, and correspondingly it gives\nrise to catastrophic particle production if the oscillation lasts indefinitely;\nthe produced number of particles exponentially increases without bound as time\nproceeds. The density matrix describing the limiting stage of the quantum state\nis determined by a small set of parameters. Moreover, the energy spectrum and\nthe intensity of produced particles are worked out in greatest detail in the\nlimit of weak coupling or small amplitude perturbation. In the case of strong\ncoupling or large amplitude perturbation the leading adiabatic formula is\nderived. Application to cosmological fate of weakly interacting spinless fields\n(WISF) such as the invisible axion, the Polonyi, and the modular fields is\ndiscussed. Although very little effect is expected on the invisible axion, the\nPolonyi type field has a chance that it catastrophically decays at an early\nepoch without much production of entropy, provided that an intrinsic coupling\nis large enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 1995 05:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
