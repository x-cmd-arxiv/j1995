The most dominant\nseasonal effect is found to be due to the wind divergence field, as determined\nby the seasonal motion of the ITCZ, through its effect on the atmospheric\nheating. The next order seasonal effects are due to the seasonality of the\nbackground SST and ocean upwelling velocity, and the corresponding mechanisms\nare analyzed. It is suggested that the seasonal forcing has a first order\neffect on ENSO's dynamics. Important aspects of the seasonal forcing may be\nincluded in idealized delayed oscillator ENSO models by making the model\nbackground seasonally shift from stable to unstable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 1995 19:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

One\nof them exploits as unperturbed the solution to the Dirac-Coulomb problem, the\nnucleus' slow motion being the source of the perturbation. The alternative\nscheme treats both the electron and the nucleus as slow, while relativistic\neffects are considered perturbatively. The short-distance contribution is found\nin the Feynman and Coulomb gauges. Recent results for P levels are confirmed,\nin contrast with those for S levels. Numerically, the shift equals 2.77 kHz for\nthe ground state and 0.51 kHz for 2S state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 1995 07:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 1995 06:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
