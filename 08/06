The composite spectrum of this source population is\nsignificantly harder than that given by the power law having the average value\nof spectral indices. Starting from spectral distributions which are\napproximately those observed from quasars, it is possible to reproduce the CXB\nspectrum from ~0.5 keV to ~20 keV. If the spectra of quasars steepen at around\n100 keV, the resulting composite spectrum nearly perfectly fits the CXB in the\neven broader energy range, up to ~100 keV. The QSO population with broadly\ndistributed spectral parameters is also characterized by a significant\ndiscrepancy between the results of hard and soft x-ray source counts. The same\npopulation of sources yields about three times more sources at 10 keV than at\nthe corresponding flux at 1 keV, similarly to what is found from the comparison\nof HEAO A-1/Ginga and Einstein/ROSAT measurements. Thus, by allowing the\nspectra of QSO's to span a broad range of spectral indices, it is possible to\nreproduce both the CXB spectrum and account for the apparent differences in\nnumber counts in different energy bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 1995 02:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
