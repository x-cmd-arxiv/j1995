The high\nresolution of HST has facilitated the discovery of this optically selected\nsample of faint lenses with small (~1 arcsec) separations between the (I ~\n25-27) lensed components and the much brighter (I ~ 19-22) lensing galaxies.\nThe sample has been discovered in the routine processing of HST fields through\nthe Medium Deep Survey pipeline, which fits simple galaxy models to broad band\nfilter images of all objects detected in random survey fields using WFPC2.\n  We show that the lens configuration can be modeled using the gravitational\nfield potential of a singular isothermal ellipsoidal mass distribution. With\nthis model the lensing potential is very similar, both in ellipticity and\norientation, to the observed light distribution of the elliptical galaxy, as\nwould occur when stars are a tracer population. The model parameters and\nassociated errors have been derived by 2-dimensional analysis of the observed\nimages. The maximum likelihood procedure iteratively converges simultaneously\non the model for the lensing elliptical galaxy and the source of the lensed\ncomponents. A systematic search is in progress for other gravitational lens\ncandidates in the HST Medium Deep Survey. This should eventually lead to a good\nstatistical estimate for lensing probabilities, and enable us to probe the\ncosmological component of the observed faint blue galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 1995 17:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We find that after a few revival cycles the wave packet ceases to reform\nat multiples of the revival time. Instead, a new series of collapses and\nrevivals commences, culminating after a time period $t_{\\rm sr} \\gg t_{\\rm\nrev}$ with the formation of a wave packet that more closely resembles the\ninitial packet than does the full revival at time $t_{\\rm rev}$.
