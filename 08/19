Such a discrepancy between solar abundances and\naverage galactic abundances by as much as a factor of two, may be evidenced by\nseveral isotopic anomalies. Local destruction of \\he3 by a similar amount could\nserve to help to reconcile the expected increase in the \\he3 abundance\npredicted by models of galactic chemical evolution.
