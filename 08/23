The wide binaries and single stars have indistinguishable\nsubmillimeter flux distributions. Thus, binary companions with separations less\nthan 50--100 AU significantly influence the nature of associated disks.\n  We have explored the hypothesis that the reduction in submillimeter flux is\nthe result of gaps cleared in disks by companions. Gap clearing produces the\nqualitative dependence of submillimeter flux on binary separation, and a simple\nmodel suggests that large gaps in disks with surface densities typical of\nwide-binary or single-star disks can reduce submillimeter fluxes to levels\nconsistent with the observed limits. This model shows that the present\nsubmillimeter flux upper limits do not necessarily imply a large reduction in\ndisk surface densities.\n  Two-thirds of the young binaries were detected by IRAS, showing that most\nbinaries have circumstellar disks. These fluxes place lower limits of 10^{-5}\nM_sun on circumstellar disk masses. The submillimeter fluxes place upper limits\nof 0.005 M_sun on circumbinary disk masses. Thus massive circumbinary disks are\nrare among binaries with separations between a few AU and 100 AU. Circumbinary\ndisks are found around some close binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 1995 16:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
