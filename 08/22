The connection between the supersymmetric Coulomb and\noscillator problems in arbitrary dimensions is outlined. Next, I treat the\nissue of finding a description of supersymmetry-based quantum-defect theory in\nterms of oscillators. A model with an anharmonic term that yields analytical\neigenfunctions is introduced to solve this problem in arbitrary dimensions.\nFinally, I show that geonium atoms (particles contained in a Penning trap)\noffer a realization of a multidimensional harmonic oscillator in an idealized\nlimit. The anharmonic theory presented here provides a means of modeling the\nrealistic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 1995 17:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 1995 05:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
