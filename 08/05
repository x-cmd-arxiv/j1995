We show that in perturbation theory the\ndecay probabilities of photons and Yang-Mills bosons vanish to all orders; the\ndecay probability of the graviton vanishes to one-loop order for graviton loops\nand to all orders for matter loops. A general power counting argument indicates\nin which conditions a decay of a massless particle could be possible: the\nlagrangian should contain a self-coupling without derivatives and with a\ncoupling constant of positive mass dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 1995 21:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 1995 16:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 1995 17:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 1996 14:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Assuming certain properties of this functor, the W characters are\nsubsequently derived from the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for KM algebras. The\nresult can be formulated in terms of a double coset of the Weyl group of the KM\nalgebra: the Hasse diagrams give the embedding diagrams of the Verma modules\nand the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials give the multiplicities in the characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 1995 17:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
