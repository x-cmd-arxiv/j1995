We present an\nalgebro-geometric approach to integrable systems, starting with those which can\nbe described in terms of spectral curves. The prototype is Hitchin's system on\nthe cotangent bundle of the moduli space of stable bundles on a curve. A\nvariant involving meromorphic Higgs bundles specializes to many familiar\nsystems of mathematics and mechanics, such as the geodesic flow on an ellipsoid\nand the elliptic solitons. We then describe some systems in which the spectral\ncurve is replaced by various higher dimensional analogues: a spectral cover of\nan arbitrary variety, a Lagrangian subvariety in an algebraically symplectic\nmanifold, or a Calabi-Yau manifold. One peculiar feature of the CY system is\nthat it is integrable analytically, but not algebraically: the Liouville tori\n(on which the system is linearized) are the intermediate Jacobians of a family\nof Calabi-Yau manifolds. Most of the results concerning these three types of\nnon-curve-based systems are quite recent. Some of them, as well as the\ncompatibility between spectral systems and the KP hierarchy, are new, while\nother parts of the story are scattered through several recent preprints.

These features travel inward in the co-moving frame at the\nradiative-acoustic characteristic speed, and thus slowly outward in the star's\nframe.

The spectral width of\nthe bosons is shown to be an important quantity: If it is too small, they do\nnot equilibrate locally and therefore strongly increase the measured\ncorrelation radius.
