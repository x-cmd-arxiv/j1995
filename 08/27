These methods, the {\\it Voronoi\ntessellation method} and {\\it Delaunay tessellation method}, are based on the\nuse of the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations of the point distribution defined\nby the locations at which the velocity field is sampled. In the Voronoi method\nthe velocity is supposed to be uniform within the Voronoi polyhedra, whereas\nthe Delaunay method constructs a velocity field by linear interpolation between\nthe four velocities at the locations defining each Delaunay tetrahedron. The\nmost important advantage of these methods is that they provide an optimal\nestimator for determining the statistics of volume-averaged quantities, as\nopposed to the available numerical methods that mainly concern mass-averaged\nquantities. As the major share of the related analytical work on velocity field\nstatistics has focussed on volume-averaged quantities, the availability of\nappropriate numerical estimators is of crucial importance for checking the\nvalidity of the analytical perturbation calculations. In addition, it allows us\nto study the statistics of the velocity field in the highly nonlinear\nclustering regime. Although in most cases both the Voronoi and the Delaunay\nmethod lead to equally good velocity field estimates, the Delaunay method may\nbe slightly preferable. In particular it performs considerably better at small\nradii. Note that it is more CPU-time intensive while its requirement for memory\nspace is almost a factor 8 lower than the Voronoi method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 1995 17:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Distortions in the frequency or spectral\ndistribution of the background probe the thermal history of the universe\nwhereas those in the angular temperature distribution probe its dynamics and\ngeometry. Stressing model independent results, we show how the microwave\nbackground can be used to extract information on the mass density, vacuum\ndensity, baryon content, radiation content, expansion rate and some aspects of\nstructure formation in the universe. To address these issues, we systematically\ndevelop relativistic kinetic and perturbation theory addressing issues such as\nfluctuation representation, or gauge, normal mode analysis in an open geometry,\nand second order effects. Through analytic and numerical results, we construct\nanisotropies in a critical, open, or cosmological constant universe with\nadiabatic and/or isocurvature initial conditions allowing for possible early\nreionization. We find that anisotropy formation is a simple process governed by\nthe Compton scattering of photons and electrons and their gravitational\ncoupling to the other particle species in the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 1995 17:15:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 22:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-17"}
