A\ndynamic account of speech rhythm is shown to be useful for description of both\nJapanese mora timing and English timing in a phrase repetition task. This\norientation contrasts fundamentally with the more familiar symbolic approach to\nphonology, in which time is modeled only with sequentially arrayed symbols. It\nis proposed that an adaptive oscillator offers a useful model for perceptual\nentrainment (or `locking in') to the temporal patterns of speech production.\nThis helps to explain why speech is often perceived to be more regular than\nexperimental measurements seem to justify. Because dynamic models deal with\nreal time, they also help us understand how languages can differ in their\ntemporal detail---contributing to foreign accents, for example. The fact that\nlanguages differ greatly in their temporal detail suggests that these effects\nare not mere motor universals, but that dynamical models are intrinsic\ncomponents of the phonological characterization of language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 1995 22:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
