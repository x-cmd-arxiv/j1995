Halos are excised from simulations of\ncosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high\nresolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy\nhalos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density\nprofiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a\nsimple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or\nequivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way\nwhich reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo\nprofiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are\nsignificantly shallower than $r^{-2}$ near the center and steeper than $r^{-2}$\nnear the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies\nrequires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity.\nFurther, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on\ngalaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the\ndisk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are\nuncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral\nsystems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the\npresence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster\nmedium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of\ncluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two\nshortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent\nwith the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted\nabundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 1995 09:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
