Several features appear in the CO\nmap which have not previously been observed: (1) a firm detection of CO line\nemission from a compact region centered on the nucleus of the galaxy; (2) the\ndetection of a triplet velocity structure characteristic of kinematically\nindependent regions shown on the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear emission ;\nand (3) the detection of a molecular bar, the extent and position angle of\nwhich are in good agreement with the 2 $\\mu$m stellar bar. The most intense CO\nemission is nonnuclear; the structure and kinematics of this emission imply\nthat this gas is distributed along the inner spiral arms and not in a ring. The\nbar's kinematic influence on the molecular gas in the spiral arms is modest,\nwith typical ordered noncircular motions of \\la\\ 30 \\kms\\ in the plane of the\ngalaxy. Interior to the spiral arms, the bar's influence is more dramatic, as\nreflected by the twisted isovelocity contours in the CO and HCN velocity\nfields. The surface density of molecular gas within the central 100 pc radius\nof NGC 1068 is the same as that in the central 200 pc radius in the Milky Way\nto within the uncertainties. There is evidence for an $m= 1$ kinematic mode in\nNGC 1068; we find the kinematic center of rotation to be displaced from the\nradio continuum center by about 2.9\", or 200 pc. The HCN image, in contrast to\nthe CO map, shows a strong concentration of emission centered on the nucleus.\nThe ratio of integrated intensities of the HCN emission to that of CO is about\n0.6 and is the highest ratio measured in the central region of any galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 1995 17:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nparticular, we re-derive here the NDE for the electron field, and show it to be\nassociated with a new conserved probability current (which allows us to work\nout a quantum probabilistic interpretation of our NDE). Actually, the Dirac\nequation is obtained from the former NDE just by averaging over a zbw cycle. We\nthen derive an equation of motion for the 4-velocity field which will allow us\nto regard the electron as an extended-type object with a classically\nintelligible internal structure.

In the present work, the magnetostrictive hysteresis is\ncomputed for a quite general case of the modified Kim-Anderson model. The\nresults obtained reproduce many features of the giant magnetostriction\n(butterfly-shaped curves) reported in the literature for measurements made on\nsingle-crystal samples of the high-temperature superconductor\n$Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8$. It is shown that addition of a contribution to the\nmagnetostriction in the superconducting state which is of similar origin as in\nthe normal state, offers a broader phenomenological interpretation of the\ncomplex magnetostriction hysteresis found in such heavy-fermion compounds as\n$UPt_3$, $URu_2Si_2$ or $UBe_{13}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 1995 16:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
