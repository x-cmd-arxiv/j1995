The transport coefficients in first order with respect to\nfrequency, which are called emittances, determine the charge emitted into a\ncontact of the sample or a gate in response to an oscillating voltage applied\nto a contact of the sample or a nearby gate. The emittances depend on the\npotential distribution inside the sample which is established in response to\nthe oscillation of the potential at a contact.
