IRAS 13349+2438 is the archetypal highly-polarized radio-quiet\nQSO and has an optical/infrared luminosity of about 2E46 erg/s. We detect\nvariability in the ROSAT count rate by a factor of 4.1 in about one year, and\nthere is also evidence for about 25 per cent variability within one week. We\nfind no evidence for large intrinsic cold absorption of soft X-rays. These two\nfacts have important consequences for the scattering-plus-transmission model of\nthis object which was developed to explain its high wavelength-dependent\npolarization and other properties. The soft X-ray variability makes electron\nscattering of most of the soft X-rays difficult without a very peculiar\nscattering mirror. The lack of significant intrinsic cold X-ray absorption\ntogether with the large observed E(B-V) suggests either a very peculiar system\ngeometry or, more probably, absorption by warm ionized gas with internal dust.\nThere is evidence for an ionized oxygen edge in the X-ray spectrum. IRAS\n13349+2438 has many properties that are similar to those of the Osterbrockian\n`narrow-line' Seyfert 1s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 1995 17:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The degree of\nmicrolensing amplification is dependent upon the size of the source, with\nsmaller sources being more amplified. In general, amplification of sources\nlarger than an Einstein radius projected onto the source plane is negligible.\nFor the quasar Q2237+0305, a quadrupole image lens (Huchra et al., 1985), this\nradius is 0.05 pc, larger than the predicted size of a continuum emitting\naccretion disk, but substantially smaller than the broad line region (Figure\n1). This scale difference implies that the continuum will be amplified while\nthe broad line emission remains essentially unchanged during a microlensing\nevent (Sanitt, 1971; Kayser et al., 1986).\n  The broad line emitting region, as a whole, is too large to be microlensed,\nbut substructure on small scales may be significantly amplified. Although the\ntotal flux in the line is relatively unchanged, microlensing of substructure\ncan result in changes in the shape of the emission line profiles, and produce\nmeasurable shifts in the central wavelength of the line (Nemiroff, 1988;\nSchneider and Wambsganss, 1990).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 1995 17:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
