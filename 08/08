Eales compared the\nradio and optical properties of a bright 3C and faint 6C sample and concluded\nthat $D\\propto(1+z)^{-1.1\\pm0.5}$ ($\\Omega_0 = 0$), with $D$ being the median\nsize of the radio sources at a given epoch and z the redshift. Oort, Katgert,\nand Windhorst, on the other hand, from a comparison of the properties of a\nnumber of radio samples, found much stronger evolution, with\n$D\\propto(1+z)^{-3.3 \\pm0.5}$. In this paper we attempt to resolve the\ndifference. We have repeated the analysis of Eales using the virtually complete\nredshift information that now exists for the 6C sample. Confining our analysis\nto FR2 sources, which we argue is the best-understood class of radio sources\nand the least likely to be affected by selection effects, we find\n$D\\propto(1+z)^{-1.2\\pm0.5}$ ($\\Omega_0 = 0$) and $D\\propto(1+z)^{-1.7\\pm0.4}$\n($\\Omega_0 = 1$).

These clump sources have similar sizes to the emission-line\nregions found around high-redshift radio galaxies, suggesting that the presence\nof dense line-emitting gas around high-redshift radio galaxies is responsible\nfor the size evolution. We show that this explanation can quantitatively\nexplain the observed size evolution, as long as there is either little X-ray\nemitting gas around these objects or, if there is, it is distributed in a\nsimilar way to the emission-line gas: highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 1995 15:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Using the generalized Cartan\nstructure equation we are able not only to determine uniquely the hermitian and\nmetric compatible connection 1-forms, but also the nonvanishing internal\ntorsion 2-form in terms of vielbeins. The resulting action has a rich and\ncomplex structure, a particular feature being the existence of massive modes.\nThus the nonvanishing internal torsion generates a Kaluza-Klein type model with\nzero and massive modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 1995 17:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
