A possible explanation is the\nblocking of extinction clouds by larger foreground clouds (occlusion), which\nshould not affect spectral line surveys much because clouds are resolved in\nvelocity space along a given line of sight. We present a simple derivation of\nthe relation between the true and occluded size distributions, assuming clouds\nare uniformly distributed in space or the distance to a cloud comples is much\ngreater than the size of the complex. Because the occlusion is dominated by the\nlargest clouds, we find that occlusion does not affect the measured size\ndistribution except for sizes comparable to the largest size, implying that\nocclusion is not responsible for the discrepancy if the range in sizes of the\nsamples is large. However, we find that the range in sizes for many of the\npublished observed samples is actually quite small, which suggests that\nocclusion does affect the extinction sample and/or that the discrepancy could\narise from the different operational definitions and selection effects involved\nin the two samples. Size and mass spectra from an IRAS survey (Wood \\etal\\\n1994) suggest that selection effects play a major role in all the surveys.

We give momentum fluctuations originating from the momentum width of\nthe nucleon wave packet to the nucleon stochastically when it is being emitted\nfrom the nucleus. We show by calculating the liquid gas phase equilibrium in\nthe case of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics, that with this improvement, we\ncan recover the quantum mechanical statistical property of the nucleus for the\nparticle emission process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 1995 04:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
