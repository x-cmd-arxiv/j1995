In contrast, for small radius carbon nanotubes, there are two\ntypes of interactions: charge-transfer (dominant for alkali atoms) leading to\nstrong ionic cohesion, and hybridization (for multivalent metal atoms)\nresulting in a smaller cohesion. For Al-atomic chains in carbon tubes, we show\nthat both effects contribute.
