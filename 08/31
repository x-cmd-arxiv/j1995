Stripping is particularly effective for infalling galaxies,\nwhich thus avoid merging. We find that, as a rule, merging is effectively\nterminated when infall becomes dominant. We look for compact groups in our\nensemble of simulations, and compare their statistical properties with\nHickson's compact groups.

Our model reconciles the contradiction\nbetween the observed absence of young merger remnants and the high rate of\ngalaxy interactions expected in compact groups. In open universes, instead,\nearlier formation of groups and suppression of secondary infall makes it more\nunlikely that compact groups survive as such until the present.

This\ncoordinate is related to an effective separation distance between the two\nnucleons by a Fujiwara transformation. This latter relationship is especially\nuseful in studying the quark substructure of light nuclei. We investigate the\nexplicit contribution of the one-gluon exchange part of the six-quark\nHamiltonian to the nucleon-nucleon potential, and we find that the dynamics are\nresponsible for a significant part of the short-range N-N repulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 1995 06:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
