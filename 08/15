Our background cosmological model is flat Euclidean space bounded by\na three-sphere, and our calculations are based on the generalized Riemann\nzeta-function. One possible set of supersymmetric local boundary conditions\ninvolves field strengths for spins 1, 3/2 and 2, the undifferentiated spin-1/2\nfield, and a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for spin 0.

An alternative set\nof boundary conditions can be motivated by studying transformation properties\nunder local supersymmetry; these involve Dirichlet conditions for the spin-2\nand spin-1 fields, a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for spin-0,\nand local boundary conditions for the spin-1/2 field and the spin-3/2\npotential.

These relations\nare used as the basis of a method for representing the effect of interactions\nin the Gaussian approximation to field theory, and it is argued that a marked\ninhomogeneity, in space-time dependence of the sources, forces a discrete\nspectrum on the field. The development of such a system is characterized by\nfeatures commonly associated with chaos and self-organization (localization by\ndomain or cell formation).
