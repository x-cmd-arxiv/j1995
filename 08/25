In systems with fewer than 3\nresolved images, however, this separation is not straightforward. A general\napproach that may be used for this purpose is presented. For simplicity, only\nthe one-dimensional case is considered in detail: Given a well-sampled time\nseries of the observed flux at two points in space with a known separation,\nchoosing a velocity $v_{\\perp}$ of the observers perpendicular to the line of\nsight determines the microlensing magnification history, and thereby also the\nintrinsic variability. The velocity is chosen by minimizing some measure\n($\\chi^2$) of the residual intrinsic variability. In many cases this gives a\nclose approximation to the true magnification. In cases where the relative\nmotion of the lensing point masses is important, only a partial separation will\nbe possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 1995 18:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In a special case of\ncategory based on representations of the quantum group U_q sl_n at roots of\nunity we show that in some of these spaces of morphisms (for U_q sl_2, in all\nof them) the action of modular group can be written in terms of values of\nMacdonald's polynomials of type A at roots of unity. This gives identities for\nthese special values, both known before (symmetry identity) and new ones.\n  The paper contains a detailed exposition of the theory of modular categories\nas well as construction of modular categories from representation of quantum\ngroups at roots of unity\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 1995 16:47:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 1995 17:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

This\nis accomplished by deriving the unitary operator of adiabatic evolution for the\nleading order. In this way it is possible to show that at least one of the\ncauses of the problem of phase-mixing, whose effect is the polynomial increase\nin time of the perturbation terms normally called secularities, arises from the\nshifts of the perturbation energy levels due to the unperturbed part of the\nhamiltonian. An example is given for a two-level system that, anyway, shows a\nsecularity at second order also in the standard theory of small perturbations.\nThe theory is applied to the quantum analog of a classical problem that can\nbecome chaotic, a particle under the effect of two waves of different\namplitudes, frequencies and wave numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 1995 23:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 1996 19:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 1996 17:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
