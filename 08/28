We measure photometric parameters\nfor each galaxy using surface photometry and draw velocity dispersions from the\nliterature. Three observables define a near-infrared Fundamental Plane (FP) of\nelliptical galaxies with $R_e \\propto \\sigma^{1.44\\pm0.04}\n\\Sigma_e^{-0.79\\pm0.04}$. The scatter in the near-infrared relation is small at\n$16.5$\\% in distance, which is equivalent to, or less than, the scatter of the\noptical FP. We suggest that the small deviation of the near-infrared FP\nrelation from the optical FP is due to the reduction of metallicity effects in\nthe near-infrared bandpass. While the small scatter of the optical FP could be\nconsistent with compensating effects of age and metallicity, the similarly\nsmall scatter of the near-infrared FP is nearly independent of metallicity and\nhence places a strong constraint on possible age spreads among elliptical\ngalaxies at every point along the FP. We suggest that the departure of the\nnear-infrared FP from the pure virial form $R_e \\propto \\sigma^2\n\\Sigma_e^{-1}$, and the corresponding observed relation $\\left( M/L \\right)\n\\propto M^{0.16\\pm 0.01}$, may be explained by slight systematic departures of\nthe structure and dynamics of elliptical galaxies from a homology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 1995 01:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

It turns out that the present\napproach can reproduce very well both the $\\pi^+$- and $K^+$- meson spectra. It\nis also demonstrated that the different kinds of descriptions for the $\\pi N\n\\to K^+ \\Lambda$ reactions substantially differentiate the calculated results\nfor the $p A \\to K^+ X$ differential cross sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 1995 10:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
