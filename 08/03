Our algorithm is a natural extension\nof the original dynamic programming recognition algorithm which recursively\ncounts the number of linkages between two words in the input sentence. The\nmodified algorithm uses the notion of a null link in order to allow a\nconnection between any pair of adjacent words, regardless of their dictionary\ndefinitions. The algorithm proceeds by making three dynamic programming passes.\nIn the first pass, the input is parsed using the original algorithm which\nenforces the constraints on links to ensure grammaticality. In the second pass,\nthe total cost of each substring of words is computed, where cost is determined\nby the number of null links necessary to parse the substring. The final pass\ncounts the total number of parses with minimal cost. All of the original\npruning techniques have natural counterparts in the robust algorithm. When used\ntogether with memoization, these techniques enable the algorithm to run\nefficiently with cubic worst-case complexity. We have implemented these ideas\nand tested them by parsing the Switchboard corpus of conversational English.\nThis corpus is comprised of approximately three million words of text,\ncorresponding to more than 150 hours of transcribed speech collected from\ntelephone conversations restricted to 70 different topics. Although only a\nsmall fraction of the sentences in this corpus are \"grammatical\" by standard\ncriteria, the robust link grammar parser is able to extract relevant structure\nfor a large portion of the sentences.
