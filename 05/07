Since these nontrivial results are\nessentially because of the CS term, hence, we first discuss in some detail the\nvarious properties of the CS term in two space dimensions. In particular, it is\npointed out that this parity (P) and time reversal (T) violating but gauge\ninvariant term when added to the Maxwell Lagrangian gives a massive gauge\nquanta and yet the theory is still gauge invariant. Further, the vacuum of such\na theory shows the magneto-electric effect. Besides, we show that the CS term\ncan also be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking as well as by radiative\ncorrections. A detailed discussion about Coleman-Hill theorem is also given\nwhich aserts that the parity-odd piece of the vacuum polarization tensor at\nzero momentum transfer is unaffected by two and multi-loop effects. Topological\nquantization of the coefficient of the CS term in nonabelian gauge theories is\nalso elaborated in some detail. One of the dramatic effect of the CS term is\nthat the vortices of the abelian (as well as nonabelian) Higgs model now\nacquire finite quantized charge and angular momentum. The various properties of\nthese vortices are discussed at length with special emphasis on some of the\nrecent developments including the discovery of the self-dual charged vortex\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 1995 17:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}
