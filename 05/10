We show that these effects are\nimportant in the recently discovered radio pulsar/main sequence star binary\nsystem PSR J0045$-$7319, and can reliably account for the observed peculiar\ntiming residuals. Precise measurements of the apsidal motion and orbital plane\nprecession can yield valuable information on the internal structure and\nrotation of the star. The detection of orbital precession implies that the spin\nof the companion star is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and\nsuggests that the supernova gave the pulsar a kick out of the original orbital\nplane. Tidal excitation of g-mode oscillations in the PSR J0045$-$7319 system\ninduces an orbital period change of order $|\\Delta P_{\\rm orb}/P_{\\rm orb}|\\sim\n10^{-6}$ at each periastron passage, but the secular trend depends on the\nradiative damping time of the g-modes.
