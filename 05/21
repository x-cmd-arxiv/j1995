We\ninvestigate the dependence of the average velocity of cars on the global\ntraffic density. At a critical threshold for the density the average velocity\nreduces drastically caused by jamming. For the low density regime we provide\nanalytical results which agree with the numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 1995 10:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We discuss the\npossible interpretation of NMR and neutron scattering experiments in these\nsystems in terms of both the non-linear $\\sigma$-model of nearly localized\nspins and a nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid description of magnetically\ncoupled quasiparticles. We show for both the 2:1:4 and 1:2:3 systems that bulk\nproperties, such as the spin susceptibiltiy, and probes at the\nantiferromagnetic wavevector $(\\pi, \\pi)$, such as $^{63}T_1$, the $ ^{63}Cu$\nspin relaxation time, both display a crossover at a temperature $T_{cr}$, which\nincreases linearly with decreasing hole concentration, from a non-universal\nregime to a $z=1$ scaling regime characterized by spin pseudogap behavior. We\npursue the consequences of the ansatz that $T_{cr}$ corresponds to a fixed\nvalue of the antiferromagnetic correlation length, $\\xi$, and show how this\nenables one to extract the magnitude and temperature dependence of $\\xi$ from\nmeasurements of $T_1$ alone. We show that like $T_{cr}$, the temperature $T_*$\nwhich marks a crossover at low temperatures from the $z=1$ scaling regime to a\nquantum disordered regime, exhibits the same dependence on doping for the 2:1:4\nand 1:2:3 systems, and so arrive at a unified description of magnetic behavior\nin the cuprates, in which the determining factor is the planar hole\nconcentration. We apply our quantitative results for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ to the\nrecent neutron scattering experiments of Fong {\\em et al}, and show that the\nspin excitation near $40 meV$ measured by them corresponds to a spin gap\nexcitation, which is overdamped in the normal state, but becomes visible in the\nsuperconducting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 1995 17:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
