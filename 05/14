The photometry was obtained as part of the French\nEROS project and has excellent phase coverage, permitting accurate\ndecomposition into Fourier components. We identify as `sinusoidal' or\ns-Cepheids those stars with periods less than 5.5 d and small second-harmonic\ncomponents. These stars comprise $\\sim$30% of our sample and most form a\nsequence $\\sim$1 mag brighter than the LMC classical Cepheids in the\nperiod-luminosity diagram. They are also generally bluer and have\nlower-amplitude light curves. We infer that the s-Cepheids are first-overtone\npulsators because, when their periods are converted to expected\nfundamental-mode values, they obey a common period-luminosity-colour relation\nwith classical Cepheids. This also confirms the reality of the colour term in\nthe Cepheid period-luminosity-colour relation. Further, the blue edge of the\nclassical Cepheid instability strip agrees well with the theoretical\ncalculations for the fundamental mode made by Chiosi et al. (1993) for the\nHertzsprung-Russell and period-luminosity diagrams, but we find that our\nobserved s-Cepheids are $>0.2$ mag brighter and bluer than the Chiosi et al.\\\npredictions for the first-overtone. We identify a number of features in plots\nof our stars' Fourier-component amplitude ratios and phase differences. These\nfeatures have been identified with resonances between different pulsation\nmodes. In the LMC we find these features seem to occur at periods very similar\nto Galactic ones for classical Cepheids, but at different periods for\ns-Cepheids. We discover a double-mode Cepheid in the LMC, for which $P({\\rm\nfirst overtone})/P({\\rm fundamental}) = 0.710 \\pm 0.001$, very similar to\nobserved ratios for Galactic double-mode Cepheids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 1995 15:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Introducing a vector-like field into the model, one finds flat\ndirections where one can study the dynamics. We unambiguously show that the\nsupersymmetry is broken when the mass of the vector-like field is small but\nfinite, and hence Witten index vanishes. If we increase the mass of the\nvector-like field, it eventually decouples from the dynamics and the models\nreduce to the original non-calculable models.
