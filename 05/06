Various\nclassical quantities associated with the black holes are derived. In\nparticular, one finds the very surprising result that the gyromagnetic and\ngyroelectric ratios can become {\\tenit arbitrarily large}. The thermodynamic\nquantities of the black holes are calculated and a Smarr-type formula is\nobtained leading to a generalized first law of black hole thermodynamics. The\nproperties of the extreme solutions are investigated and it is shown how they\nnaturally separate into two classes. The extreme solutions in one class are\nfound to have two unusual properties: (i). Their event horizons have zero\nangular velocity and yet they have non-zero ADM angular momentum. (ii). In\ncertain circumstances it is possible to add angular momentum to these extreme\nsolutions without changing the mass or charges and yet still maintain an\nextreme solution. Regarding the extreme black holes as elementary particles,\ntheir stability is discussed and it is found that they are stable provided they\nhave sufficient angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 1995 10:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Our calculation of hardness extends the\napproach of Teter\\cite{teter} not only by including self-consistency, but also\nby generalizing to non-diagonal hardness matrices, thereby allowing us to test\nfor transferability to non-spherically symmetric environments. We apply the\nmethod to study the transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials for a\nvariety of elements in the Periodic Table. We find that the self-consistent\ncorrections are frequently significant, and should not be neglected. We prove\nthat the partial-core correction improves the pseudopotential hardness of\nalkali metals considerably. We propose a quantity to represent the average\nhardness error and calculate this quantity for many representative elements as\na function of pseudopotential cutoff radii. We find that the atomic\npolarizabilities are usually well reproduced by the norm-conserving\npseudopotentials. Our results provide useful guidelines for making optimal\nchoices in the pseudopotential generation procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 1995 21:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
