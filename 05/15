Disney (1976) suggested that the constancy of disk\ncentral surface brightness noticed by Freeman (1970) was not a physical result,\nbut instead was an artifact of sample selection. Since LSB galaxies do exist,\nthe pertinent and still controversial issue is if these newly discovered\ngalaxies constitute a significant percentage of the general galaxy population.\nIn this paper, we address this issue by determining the space density of\ngalaxies as a function of disk central surface brightness. Using the physically\nreasonable assumption (which is motivated by the data) that central surface\nbrightness is independent of disk scale length, we arrive at a distribution\nwhich is roughly flat (i.e. approximately equal numbers of galaxies at each\nsurface brightness) faintwards of the Freeman (1970) value. Brightwards of\nthis, we find a sharp decline in the distribution which is analogous to the\nturn down in the luminosity function at $L^*$. An intrinsically sharply peaked\n``Freeman Law'' distribution can be completely ruled out, and no Gaussian\ndistribution can fit the data. Low surface brightness galaxies (those with\ncentral surface brightnesses fainter than $22~B\\sb$) comprise $\\gtrsim 1/2$ the\ngeneral galaxy population, so a representative sample of galaxies at $z = 0$\ndoes not really exist at present since past surveys have been insensitive to\nthis component of the general galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 1995 16:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
