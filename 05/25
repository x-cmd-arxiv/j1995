The aim is to predict the pattern\nthat the growth evolves into, whether it becomes fractal and if so the\ncharacteristics of the fractal pattern. Using a time dependent map the growing\nregion is conformally mapped onto the unit disk and the problem is converted to\nthe dynamics of a many-body system. The evolution is argued to be Hamiltonian,\nand the Hamiltonian is shown to be the conjugate function of the real potential\nfield. Without surface effects the problem is ill-posed, but the Hamiltonian\nstructure of the dynamics allows introduction of surface effects as a repulsive\npotential between the particles and the interface. This further leads to a\nfield representation of the problem, where the field's vacuum harbours the\nzeros and the poles of the conformal map as particles and antiparticles. These\ncan be excited from the vacuum either by fluctuations or by surface effects.\nCreation and annihilation of particles is shown to be consistent with the\nformalism and lead to tip-splitting and side-branching. The Hamiltonian further\nallows to make use of statistical mechanical tools to analyse the statistics of\nthe many-body system. I outline the way to convert the distribution of the\nparticles into the morphology of the interface. In particular, I relate the\nparticles statistics to the distributions of the curvature and the growth\nprobability along the physical interface and to the fractal dimension. If the\npattern turns fractal the latter distribution gives rise to a multifractal\nspectrum, which can be explicitly calculated for a given particles\ndistribution.

Our earlier works\nhave discussed the quantum origin of noise in stochastic inflation and quantum\nfluctuations as measured by particle creation in semiclassical gravity. Here we\nfocus on decoherence and the relation of quantum and classical fluctuations.\nInstead of using the rather ad hoc splitting of a quantum field into long and\nshort wavelength parts, the latter providing the noise which decoheres the\nformer, we treat a nonlinear theory and examine the decoherence of a quantum\nmean field by its own quantum fluctuations, or that of other fields it\ninteracts with. This is an example of `dynamical decoherence' where an\neffective open quantum system decoheres through its own dynamics. The model we\nuse to discuss fluctuation generation has the inflation field coupled to the\ngraviton field. We show that when the quantum to classical transition is\nproperly treated, with due consideration of the relation of decoherence, noise,\nfluctuation and dissipation, the amplitude of density contrast predicted falls\nin the acceptable range without requiring a fine tuning of the coupling\nconstant of the inflation field ($\\lambda$). The conventional treatment which\nrequires an unnaturally small $\\lambda \\approx 10^{-12}$ stems from a basic\nflaw in naively identifying classical perturbations with quantum fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 1995 18:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The presence of a coupling term in the single particle\nHamiltonian between the particle motion and the collective coordinate generates\na fully selfconsistent dynamics. We consider in particular monopole\noscillations and demonstrate that self-consistency is essential in order to\ninduce chaotic single-particle motion. We also discuss the dissipative\nbehaviour of the wall motion and its relation with the order-to-chaos\ntransition in the dynamics of the microscopic degrees of freedom. Analogous\nconsiderations can be extended to higher multipolarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 1995 12:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
