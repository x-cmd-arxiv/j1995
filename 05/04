In\nthis work, experiments were done to compare the DGA's performance on the Royal\nRoad class of fitness functions to that of the CGA. Besides achieving\nsuperlinear speedup on KSR parallel computers, the DGA again outperformed the\nCGA on the functions R3 and R4 with regard to the metrics of best fitness,\naverage fitness, and number of times the optimum was reached. Its performance\non R1 and R2 was comparable to that of the CGA. The effect of varying the DGA's\nmigration parameters was also investigated.
