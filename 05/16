The deflection of the pulsar's beam\ntrajectory in the gravitational field of its companion leads to variation in\nthe pulsar's rotational phase. This variation appears as the narrow sharp\ngrowth of the magnitude of the post-fit pulsar timing residuals in the vicinity\nof the moment of the superior conjunction of the pulsar with its companion. In\ncontrast to the relativistic Shapiro effect the amplitude of the effect of\ngravitational deflection of the pulsar radio beam has two peaks with opposite\nsigns, which become sharper as the inclination $i$ of the pulsar's orbit\napproaches 90$^{\\circ}$. The effect under consideration influences the\nestimation of parameters of the relativistic Shapiro effect in the binary\npulsars with nearly edgewise orbits. Its inclusion in the fitting procedure\nprovide more careful measurement of sine of the orbital inclination $i$ as well\nas the masses of the pulsar $m_p$ and its companion $m_c$. This permits an\nimproved testing of alternative theories of gravity in the strong field regime.\nMoreover, the measurement of this effect permits independent geometric\nconstraints on the position of the pulsar rotational axis in space. The effect\nof the gravitational deflection of light has been numerically investigated for\nbinary pulsars with nearly edgewise orbits. It is shown that the effect is\nobserved in general only when $\\cos i\\leq 0.003.$ This estimate becomes less\nrestrictive as the pulsar's spin axis approaches the line of the sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 1995 18:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

A closed\nexpression is obtained for the case of multiparameter (twisted) quantum\n$gl(N)$. The factorized nature of standard quantum groups, that allows the\nexplicit expression for $U\\hskip-1mm T $ to be obtained with relative ease,\nextends to some nonstandard quantum groups, such as those based on $A_n^{(2)}$,\nand perhaps to all. The paper is mostly concerned with parameters in general\nposition, but the extension to roots of unity is also explored, in the case of\n$g\\ell(N)$. The structure of the dual is now radically different, and an\ninteresting generalization of the $q$-exponential appears in the formulas for\nthe Universal T- and R-matrices. The projection to quantum $sl(N)$ is simple\nand direct; this allows, in particular, to apply recent results concerning\ndeformations of twisted $gl(N)$ to the semisimple quotient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 1995 07:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

Given a decomposition $V\\otimes\nV=\\oplus_i^n I_i$, define $n$ quadratic algebras $(V, J_m)$ where\n$J_m=\\oplus_{i\\neq m} I_i$. This decomposition defines also the quantum\nsemigroup $M(V;I_1,...,I_n)$ which acts on all these quadratic algebras. With\nthe decomposition we associate a family of associative algebras\n$A_k=A_k(I_1,...I_n)$, $k\\geq 2$. In the classical case, when $V\\otimes V$\ndecomposes into the symmetric and skewsymmetric tensors, $A_k$ coincides with\nthe group algebra of the symmetric group $S_k$. Let $I_{ih}$ be deformations of\nthe subspaces $I_i$. In the paper we give a criteria for flatness of the\ncorresponding deformations of the quadratic algebras $(V[[h]],J_{ih}$ and the\nquantum semigroup $M(V[[h]];I_{1h},...,I_{nh})$. It says that the deformations\nwill be flat if the algebras $A_k(I_1,...,I_n)$ are semisimple and under the\ndeformation their dimension does not change.\n  Usually, the decomposition into $I_i$ is defined by a given Yang-Baxter\noperator $S$ on $V\\otimes V$, for which $I_i$ are its eigensubspaces, and the\ndeformations $I_{ih}$ are defined by a deformation $S_h$ of $S$. We consider\nthe cases when $S_h$ is a deformation of Hecke or Birman-Wenzl symmetry, and\nalso the case when $S_h$ is the Yang-Baxter operator which appears by a\nrepresentation of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group. Applying the flatness\ncriteria we prove that in all these cases we obtain flat deformations of the\nquadratic algebras and the corresponding quantum semigroups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 1995 15:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
