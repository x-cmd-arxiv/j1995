There are two distinct types of\nnegaton solutions which we label $[S^{n}]$ and $[C^{n}]$, where $(n+1)$ is the\norder of the Wronskian used in the derivation. For negatons, the number of\nsingularities and zeros is finite and they show very interesting time\ndependence. The general motion is in the positive $x$ direction, except for\ncertain negatons which exhibit one oscillation around the origin. In contrast,\nthere is just one type of positon solution, which we label $[\\tilde C^n]$. For\npositons, one gets a finite number of singularities for $n$ odd, but an\ninfinite number for even values of $n$. The general motion of positons is in\nthe negative $x$ direction with periodic oscillations. Negatons and positons\nretain their identities in a scattering process and their phase shifts are\ndiscussed. We obtain a simple explanation of all phase shifts by generalizing\nthe notions of ``mass\" and ``center of mass\" to singular solutions. Finally, it\nis shown that negaton and positon solutions of the KdV equation can be used to\nobtain corresponding new solutions of the modified KdV equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 1995 13:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}
