At beam energies\naround 55 MeV/nucleon, the composite system in thermal equilibrium but isospin\nnon-equilibrium breaks up into two primary hot residues with N/Z ratios closely\nrelated to those of the target and projectile respectively. The decay of these\nforward-backward moving residues results in the strong isospin asymmetry in\nspace and the dependence of the isotopic composition of fragments on the N/Z\nratios of the target and projectile. These features are in good agreement with\nthose found recently in experiments at NSCL/MSU and TAMU, implications of these\nfindings are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 1995 02:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Using this model, we first study the\ngeneral collision dynamics between heavy ions at the AGS energies. We then show\nthat in central collisions there exists a large volume of sufficiently\nlong-lived superdense hadronic matter whose local baryon and energy densities\nexceed the critical densities for the hadronic matter to quark-gluon plasma\ntransition. The size and lifetime of this matter are found to depend strongly\non the equation of state. We also investigate the degree and time scale of\nthermalization as well as the radial flow during the expansion of the\nsuperdense hadronic matter. The flow velocity profile and the temperature of\nthe hadronic matter at freeze-out are extracted. The transverse momentum and\nrapidity distributions of protons, pions and kaons calculated with and without\nthe mean field are compared with each other and also with the preliminary data\nfrom the E866/E802 collaboration to search for experimental observables that\nare sensitive to the equation of state. It is found that these inclusive,\nsingle particle observables depend weakly on the equation of state. The\ndifference between results obtained with and without the nuclear mean field is\nonly about 20\\%. The baryon transverse collective flow in the reaction plane is\nalso analyzed. It is shown that both the flow parameter and the strength of the\n``bounce-off'' effect are very sensitive to the equation of state. In\nparticular, a soft equation of state with a compressibility of 200 MeV results\nin an increase of the flow parameter by a factor of 2.5 compared to the cascade\ncase without the mean field. This large effect makes it possible to distinguish\nthe predictions from different theoretical models and to detect the signatures\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 1995 02:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
