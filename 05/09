We\ngive a concise introduction to that method, illustrate its power by using it to\nanalyze the well-known rate and quantum Boltzmann equations, and present, as a\nnew application, the derivation of a source term accounting for the spontaneous\ncreation of electron-positron pairs in strong fields. Thereby we emphasize the\nfundamental importance of time scales: only if the various time scales\nexhibited by the dynamics are widely disparate, can the evolution of the slower\ndegrees of freedom be described by a conventional Markovian transport equation;\notherwise, one must account for finite memory effects. We show how the\nprojection method can be employed to determine these time scales, and how --if\nnecessary-- it allows one to include memory effects in a straightforward\nmanner. Finally, there is an appendix in which we discuss the concepts of\nentropy and macroscopic irreversibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 1995 16:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}

It is based on the assumption that whenever\nprobability distributions arise, there exists a stochastic process that is\neither responsible for temporal evolution of a given measure or preserves the\nmeasure in the stationary case. Our departure point is the so-called\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger problem of probabilistic evolution, which provides for a unique\nMarkov stochastic interpolation between any given pair of boundary probability\ndensities for a process covering a fixed, finite duration of time, provided we\nhave decided a priori what kind of primordial dynamical semigroup transition\nmechanism is involved. In the nonrelativistic theory, including quantum\nmechanics, Feyman-Kac-like kernels are the building blocks for suitable\ntransition probability densities of the process. In the standard \"free\" case\n(Feynman-Kac potential equal to zero) the familiar Wiener noise is recovered.\nIn the framework of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger problem, the \"free noise\" can also be\nextended to any infinitely divisible probability law, as covered by the\nL\\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula. Since the relativistic Hamiltonians $|\\nabla |$\nand $\\sqrt {-\\triangle +m^2}-m$ are known to generate such laws, we focus on\nthem for the analysis of probabilistic phenomena, which are shown to be\nassociated with the relativistic wave (D'Alembert) and matter-wave\n(Klein-Gordon) equations, respectively. We show that such stochastic processes\nexist and are spatial jump processes. In general, in the presence of external\npotentials, they do not share the Markov property, except for stationary\nsituations. A concrete example of the pseudodifferential Cauchy-Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nevolution is analyzed in detail.
