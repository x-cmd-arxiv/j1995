The\nsubsequent growth of the surface magnetic field occurs owing to ohmic diffusion\nof a strong internal field (10^12-10^13 G) and proceeds over a time scale of\n10^2-10^3 yrs, depending on the early thermal history of the NS, the initial\ndistribution of magnetic flux and the electrical resistivity in the stellar\ncrust, as well as on the details of the stellar structure. Referring to this\nsuggestion, we perform numerical computations to demonstrate its possible\nrelevance to young radio pulsars. In our calculations, we use different NS\nstructures based on a model of dense matter presenting a phase transition to\nkaon condensation which implies both slow and fast neutrino cooling, depending\non the stellar mass.
