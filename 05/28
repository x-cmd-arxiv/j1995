These monopoles are associated with\nSpin^h(4)-structures on 4-manifolds and form finite-dimensional moduli spaces.\nOn a Kahler surface the quaternionic monopole equations decouple and lead to\nthe projective vortex equation for holomorphic pairs. This vortex equation\ncomes from a moment map and gives rise to a new complex-geometric stability\nconcept. The moduli spaces of quaternionic monopoles on Kahler surfaces have\ntwo closed subspaces, both naturally isomorphic with moduli spaces of\ncanonically stable holomorphic pairs. These components intersect along\nDonaldsons instanton space and can be compactified with Seiberg-Witten moduli\nspaces. This should provide a link between the two corresponding theories.\nNotes: To appear in CMP The revised version contains more details concerning\nthe Uhlenbeck compactfication of the moduli space of quaternionic monopoles,\nand possible applications are discussed.

The use of lobe flux density as a means of normalizing\nthe boosted core flux density to the available intrinsic power of the central\nengine introduces scatter. This is because the emission from the radio lobes\ndepends strongly on the interaction of the jet with the environment at\ndistances beyond several Kpc from the nucleus. Total kinetic power in the\nextended radio emission is approximately proportional to emission line\nluminosity, and emission line luminosity is proportional to the luminosity of\nAGNs' featureless continua -- both over 4 orders of magnitude. Thus, quasars'\noptical luminosity may be an excellent measure of available intrinsic jet\npower. Therefore we define a new core dominance parameter, R$_V$, the ratio of\nradio core to optical (rest frame V band) continuum luminosity, that is not\ndirectly dependent on jet interactions with the super-Kpc-scale environment. We\nshow that the use of R$_V$, rather than R, results in significantly improved\ninverse correlations with the beaming angle as deduced from apparent\nsuperluminal velocities and inverse Compton scattered X-ray emission, and with\nthe FWHM of quasars' broad H$\\beta$ emission line. We discuss some implications\nand applications of the new parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 May 1995 18:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
