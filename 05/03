Here we investigate the secular and dynamical 3rd-harmonic\ninstabilities that appear first on the Jacobi sequence of incompressible zero-\nvorticity ellipsoids. Poincare found a bifurcation point on the Jacobi sequence\nwhere a 3rd-harmonic mode becomes neutral. A sequence of pear-shaped equilibria\nbranches off at this point but stands at higher energies. Therefore, the Jacobi\nellipsoids remain secularly and dynamically stable. Cartan found that dynamical\n3rd-harmonic instability also sets in at the Jacobi-pear bifurcation. We find\nthat Cartan's instability leads to differentially rotating objects and not to\nuniformly rotating pear-shaped equilibria. We demonstrate that the pear-shaped\nsequence exists at higher energies and at higher rotation relative to the\nJacobi sequence. The Jacobi ellipsoid undergoes fission on a secular time scale\nand a short-period binary is produced. The classical fission hypothesis of\nbinary-star formation of Poincare and Darwin is thus feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 1995 17:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
