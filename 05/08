Phase transitions in the\nsupranuclear equation of state (EOS) may change the cooling history of the\ncollapsed stellar core and may even lead to a collapse of the protoneutron star\nto a black hole on a time scale of several seconds. The implications of such a\nscenario for the characteristics of the neutrino emission are tested. Moreover,\nthe consequences of a reduction of the neutrino opacities by a possible\nsuppression of the axial-vector interaction in a dense medium (Raffelt and\nSeckel 1994) are investigated. Since the strongest constraints from SN~1987A\nfor the considered theories rely on the signal duration marked by the last\nthree events in Kamiokande, we also discuss attempts to explain these events\ndifferent from the standard protoneutron star cooling scenario. In particular,\nattention is focussed on the scenario of a rapid cooling of the protoneutron\nstar within the time interval of the first 8 Kamiokande events or the IMB\nsignal which is only about 2--$5\\,{\\rm s}$. Such a short neutrino emission\ncould be the consequence of low neutrino opacities or convectively enhanced\nneutrino transport. Since the driving force of neutrino heating around the\nprotoneutron star diminishes, the pressure support of the overlying material\ndecreases and some matter might fall back to the neutron star. However,\nanalytical estimates and numerical simulations indicate that the neutrino\nemission associated with the accretion of this material is hardly energetic\nenough to account for the last bunch of neutrinos at Kamiokande.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 1995 19:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
