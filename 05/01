As a\nresult, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI,\nhindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded\noptimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a\nsolution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture\nand the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property\nfor a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time\nenvironments.

We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs\nthat are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO\nprograms can be used as building blocks for more complex systems.
