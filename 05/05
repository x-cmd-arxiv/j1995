Our comparison of new optical data and archival ROSAT PSPC\nX-ray data reveal three collision signatures predicted by n-body/hydrodynamical\nsimulations of hierarchical cluster evolution. First, there is strong evidence\nof a non-hydrostatic process; neither of the two major clumps in the galaxy\ndistribution lies on the off-center peak of the X-ray emission from the\nintracluster gas. Second, the peak of the X-ray emission is elongated\nperpendicular to the collision axis defined by the centroids of the two galaxy\nclumps. Third, there is evidence of compression-heated gas; one of A754's two\nX-ray temperature components (Henry & Briel 1995) is among the hottest observed\nin any cluster and hotter than that inferred from the velocity dispersion of\nthe associated galaxy clump. These signatures are consistent with the\nqualitative features of simulations (Evrard 1990a,b) in which two subclusters\nhave collided in the plane of the sky during roughly the last Gyr. The\ndetection of such collisions is crucial for understanding both the dynamics of\nindividual clusters and the underlying cosmology. First, for systems like A754,\nestimating the cluster X-ray mass from assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium\nand isothermality is incorrect and may produce the discrepancies sometimes\nfound between X-ray masses and those derived from gravitational lens models\n(Babul & Miralda-Escude 1994). Second, the fraction of nearby clusters in which\nsubclusters have collided in the last Gyr is especially sensitive to the mean\nmass density parameter Omega_0 (cf. Richstone et al. 1992; Evrard et al. 1993;\nLacey & Cole 1993). With a large, well-defined cluster sample, it will be\npossible to place a new and powerful constraint on cosmological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 1995 16:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Two types of recursion relations for anomalous\nrelative multiplicities are obtained. One of them is proved to be the\nfactorized version of the other. The factorization property is based on the\nexistence of the set of weights $\\Gamma$ specific for each injection. The\nstructure of $\\Gamma$ is easily deduced from the correspondence between the\nroot systems of algebra and subalgebra. The recursion relations thus obtained\ngive rise to simple and effective algorithm for branching rules. The details\nare exposed by performing the explicit decomposition procedure for $A_{3}\n\\oplus u(1) \\to B_{4}$ injection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 1995 16:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
