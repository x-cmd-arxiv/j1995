Even more massive main-sequence stars would, presumably, chiefly g o\ninto high-mass ($\\sim 10 M_{\\odot}$) black holes. The Brown-Bethe estimates\ngave approximately $5 \\times {10}^{8}$ low-mass black holes in the Galaxy. A\npressing question, which we attempt to answer here, is why, with the possible\nexception of the compact objects in SN1987A and 4U\\,1700--37, none of these\nhave been seen.\n  We address this question in three parts. Firstly, black holes are generally\n``seen'' only in binaries, by the accretion of matter from a companion star.\nHigh mass black holes are capable of accreting more matter than low-mass black\nholes, so there is a selection effect favoring them. This, in itself, would not\nbe sufficient to show why low-mass black holes have not been seen, since\nneutron stars (of nearly the same mass) are seen in abundance.\n  Secondly, and this is our main point, the primary star in a binary ---the\nfirst star to evolve--- loses its hydrogen envelope by transfer of matter to\nthe secondary and loss into space, and the resulting ``naked'' helium star\nevolves differently than a helium core, which is at least initially covered by\nthe hydrogen envelope in a massive main-sequence star. We show that primary\nstars in binaries can end up as neutron stars even if their initial mass\nsubstantially exceeds the mass limit for neutron star formation from single\nstars ($\\sim 18 M_{\\odot}$).
