By measuring such distortions in\nthe linear regime one can constrain the quantity $\\beta = \\Omega^{0.6}/b$ where\n$\\Omega$ is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the (linear) bias\nfactor for optically-selected galaxies. In this paper we apply two techniques\nfor estimating $\\beta$ from the Stromlo-APM redshift survey --- (1) measuring\nthe anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function in spherical\nharmonics and (2) comparing the amplitude of the direction-averaged redshift\nspace correlation function to the real space correlation function. We test the\nvalidity of these techniques, particularly whether the assumption of linear\ntheory is justified, using two sets of large $N$-body simulations. We find that\nthe first technique is affected by non-linearities on scales up to $\\sim 30\n\\hMpc$. The second technique is less sensitive to non-linear effects and so is\nmore useful for existing redshift surveys. The Stromlo-APM survey data favours\na low value for $\\beta$, with $\\beta \\simlt 0.6$. A bias parameter $b \\approx\n2$ is thus required if $\\Omega \\equiv 1$. However, higher-order correlations\nmeasured from the APM galaxy survey (Gazta\\~{n}aga and Frieman 1994) indicate a\nlow value for the bias parameter $b \\approx 1$, requiring that $\\Omega \\simlt\n0.5$. We also measure the relative bias for samples of galaxies of various\nluminosity and morphological type and find that low-luminosity galaxies are\nroughly three times less biased than $L^*$ galaxies. For the galaxy population\nas a whole, we measure a real space variance of galaxy counts in $8 \\hMpc$\nspheres of $(\\sigma^2_8)_g = 0.89 \\pm 0.05$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 1995 17:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 1996 19:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Furthermore, we\ncalculate the propagator of the corresponding U(1) gauge field, which mediates\na long-range transverse interaction between the bosonic and fermionic fields.\nIt is found that the strength of the propagator is proportional to the gap of\nthe spin-excitations. Therefore, we expect as a consequence of this long-range\ninteraction the formation of bound states when the spin-gap opens, i.e.\\ in the\nQD spin-liquid phase. The possible bound states are spin-waves with a (spin-)\ngap in the excitation spectrum, spinless fermions and pairs of fermions. Thus,\nan alternative picture for charge-spin separation emerges, with composite\ncharge-separated excitations. Moreover, the present treatment shows an intimate\nconnection between the opening of the spin-gap and charge-spin separation as\nwell as pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 1995 14:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
