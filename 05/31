A parametrised model, Q, for\nthe state vector evolution of spin 1/2 particles during measurement is\ndeveloped. Q draws on recent work on so-called riddled basins in dynamical\nsystems theory, and is local, deterministic, nonlinear and time asymmetric.\nMoreover the evolution of the state vector to one of two chaotic attractors\n(taken to represent observed spin states) is effectively uncomputable.\nMotivation for this model arises from Penrose's speculations about the nature\nand role of quantum gravity. Although the evolution of Q's state vector is\nuncomputable, the probability that the system will evolve to one of the two\nattractors is computable. These probabilities correspond quantitatively to the\nstatistics of spin 1/2 particles. In an ensemble sense the evolution of the\nstate vector towards an attractor can be described by a diffusive random walk.\nBell's theorem and a version of the Bell-Kochen_specker quantum entanglement\nparadox are discussed. It is shown that proving an inconsistency with locality\ndemands the existence of definite truth values to certain counterfactual\npropositions. In Q these deterministic propositions are physically uncomputable\nand no non-algorithmic solution is either known or suspected. Adapting the\nmathematical formalist approach, the non-existence of definite truth values to\nsuch counterfactual propositions is posited. No inconsistency with experiment\nis found. Hence Q is not necessarily constrained by Bell's inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 1995 15:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
