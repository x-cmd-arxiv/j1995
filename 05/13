A Galerkin\napproximation for realistic boundary conditions that describes stationary and\noscillatory convection in the form of straight parallel rolls is used to\ndetermine the influence of the Dufour effect on the bifurcation behaviour of\nconvective flow intensity, vertical heat current, and concentration mixing. The\nDufour--induced changes in the bifurcation topology and the existence regimes\nof stationary and traveling wave convection are elucidated. To check the\nvalidity of the Galerkin results we compare with finite--difference numerical\nsimulations of the full hydrodynamical field equations. Furthermore, we report\non the scaling behaviour of linear properties of the stationary instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 1995 16:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
