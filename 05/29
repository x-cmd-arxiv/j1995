We do not restrict the Lagrangian to be the sum\nof the standard Hilbert and Yang-Mills Lagrangians, but allow for more general\ndiffeomorphism and gauge invariant actions. The analysis is carried out in all\nspacetime dimensions larger than 2 and for all ghost numbers. This covers the\nclassification of all candidate anomalies, of all consistent deformations of\nthe action, as well as the computation of the (equivariant) characteristic\ncohomology, i.e. the cohomology of the spacetime exterior derivative in the\nspace of (gauge invariant) local differential forms modulo forms that vanish\non-shell. We show in particular that for a semi-simple Yang-Mills gauge group\nthe antifield dependence can be entirely removed both from the consistent\ndeformations of the Lagrangian and from the candidate anomalies. Thus, the\nallowed deformations of the action necessarily preserve the gauge structure,\nwhile the only candidate anomalies are those provided by previous works not\ndealing with antifields, and by ``topological\" candidate anomalies which are\npresent only in special spacetime dimensions (6,9,10,13,...). This result no\nlonger holds in presence of abelian factors where new candidate anomalies and\ndeformations of the action can be constructed out of the conserved Noether\ncurrents (if any). The Noether currents themselves are shown to be\ncovariantizable, with a few exceptions discussed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 1995 12:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 1995 08:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
