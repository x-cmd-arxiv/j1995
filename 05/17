First, the magnification bias due to lensing raises faint\nQSOs above a given magnitude threshold and thereby enhances the probability for\nobserving damped absorption systems. Second, the bending of light rays from the\nsource effectively limits the minimum impact parameter of the line-of-sight\nrelative to the center of the absorber, thus providing an upper cut-off to the\nobserved neutral hydrogen (HI) column density. The combination of these effects\nyields a pronounced peak in the observed abundance of absorbers with high\ncolumn densities (>2*10^{21} cm^{-2}) and low redshifts (z<1). The inferred\nvalue of the cosmological density parameter of neutral hydrogen, Omega_{HI},\nincreases with increasing redshift and luminosity of the sources even if the\ntrue HI density remains constant.

The new family symmetry dynamics might be connected to the\nexistence of some exotic gauge or matter fields or something yet. For this it\nwill better to study the possibilities of the appearence this gauge symmetry in\nthe framework of the Grand Unified String Theories. In the framework of four\ndimensional heterotic superstring with free fermions we investigate the rank\neight Grand Unified String Theories (GUST) which contain the $SU(3)_H$-gauge\nfamily symmetry. We explicitly construct GUST with gauge symmetry $G = SU(5)\n\\times U(1)\\times (SU(3) \\times U(1))_H$ and $G = SO(10)\\times (SU(3) \\times\nU(1))_H$ $\\subset SO(16)$ or $E(6)\\times SU(3)_H$ $\\subset E(8)$ in free\ncomplex fermion formulation. As the GUSTs originating from Kac-Moody algebras\n(KMA) contain only low-dimensional representations it is usually difficult to\nbreak the gauge symmetry. We solve this problem taking for the observable gauge\nsymmetry the diagonal subgroup $G^{sym}$ of rank $16$ group $G\\times G\\subset\nSO(16)\\times SO(16)$ or $(E(6) \\times SU(3)_H)^2 $ $\\subset E(8)\\times E(8)$.\nWe discuss the possible fermion matter and Higgs sectors in these models. In\nthese GUST there has to exist \"superweak\" light chiral matter($m_H^f < M_W$).\nThe understanding of quark and lepton mass spectra and family mixing leave a\npossibility for the existence of an unusually low mass breaking scale of the\n$SU(3)_H$ family gauge symmetry\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 1995 19:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Particular attention is given to its recently discovered\nsuperconducting phase with a $T_c$ of 16.4 K, reported to have the NbO\nstructure type. Results of total energy calculations show that it is in fact\nenergetically unfavorable for NbN to form in this cubic structure, and its\npredicted theoretical lattice constant is significantly smaller than the\nexperimental value. Various approaches to the identification of an alternative\nstructure are discussed. In preliminary investigations, we have found two new\nstructures that are energetically more favorable than the NbO structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 1995 13:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
