In this paper, we investigate the production and decay of\nthese particles at the high energy e^+ e^- experiments, LEP II and NLC. We find\nthat, in WTC models, the production of neutral PGBs can be significantly\nenhanced, by one or two orders of magnitude, with respect to the predictions of\ntraditional (QCD-like) TC models. The origin of such an enhancement is the\nexistence of several low energy TC scales, that are likely to appear in WTC\ntheories. This could allow the PGBs to be observed even at the energy and\nluminosity of the LEP II experiment. At LEP II, the PGBs are expected to be\nproduced in the e^+ e^- ==> P \\gamma channel, and, possibly, in the e^+ e^- ==>\nP e^+ e^- channel, with a total rate that can be of the order of several tenths\nper year. Due to the typical large values of PGB masses, the relative branching\nratios of PGB decays, in WTC theories, are different from those predicted in\ntraditional TC models. In particular, a large fraction of these decays can\noccur in the P ==> \\gamma \\gamma channel. In considering the PGB production, at\nLEP II, we find that, in most of the final states, the distinctive signatures\nof WTC events should allow the Standard Model background to be reduced to a\nnegligible level. We also find that, at a 500 GeV NLC experiment, the\nproduction of neutral PGBs can occur in several channels, and can be of the\norder of 10^3 events per year. Instead, when we consider traditional TC models,\nwe find that no PGB are typically predicted to be observed, both at LEP II and\nthe NLC experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 1995 14:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 1995 17:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Consequently, the Lie algebra of physical states decomposes into a\ndirect sum of the hyperbolic algebra and the space of decoupled states. Both\nthese spaces contain transversal and longitudinal states. Longitudinal\ndecoupling holds generally, and may also be valid for uncompactified strings,\nwith possible consequences for Liouville theory; the identification of the\ndecoupled states simply amounts to finding the zeroes of certain ``decoupling\npolynomials''. This is not the case for transversal decoupling, which crucially\ndepends on special properties of the root lattice, as we explicitly demonstrate\nfor a non-trivial root space of $E_{10}$. Because the $N$-vertices of the\ncompactified string contain the complete information about decoupling, all the\nproperties of the hyperbolic algebra are encoded into them.

Stochastic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are\nexplicitly shown to follow renormalisation group trajectories.\n  It is proven that solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation asymptotically\nconverge to fixed points which are conformal field theories. A particular fixed\npoint is given by the free Gaussian field with a charge at infinity. The stream\nfunction is identified with a vertex operator. It happens that this solution\nalso admits constant $n$-enstrophy fluxes in the asymptotic regime, therefore\nfulfilling all requirements to represent an asymptotic state of two-dimensional\nturbulence.\n  The renormalisation basin of attraction of this fixed point consists of a\ncharged Coulomb gas. This Coulomb gas gives an effective description of\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 1995 14:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
