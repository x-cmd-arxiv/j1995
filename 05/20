Classically, such spacetimes are locally indistinguishable\nfrom their globally hyperbolic covering spaces. However, the construction of a\nquantum field theory (QFT) is more problematic. One can define a family of\nlocal algebras on an atlas of globally hyperbolic subspacetimes. But one cannot\nextend a generic positive linear function from a single algebra to the\ncollection of all local algebras without violating positivity, while satisfying\nthe physically appropriate overlap conditions. This difficulty can be overcome\nby restricting the size of neighborhoods so that the union of any pair is time-\norientable. The structure of local algebras and states is then locally\nindistinguishable from that of QFT on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. But this\nsize restriction on neighborhoods makes the structure unsatisfactory as a\nglobal field theory. The theory allows less information than QFT in a globally\nhyperbolic spacetime, because correlations between field operators at a pair of\npoints are defined only if a curve joining the points lies in a single neigh-\nborhood. Moreover, to extend a local state to a collection of states, we use an\nantipodally symmetric state on the covering space, a state that would not yield\na sensible state on the spacetime if all correlations could be measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 1995 21:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

This proposal can be expected to be quite sound only when the\nfluctuations in the energy-momentum tensor of the quantum field are negligible.\nBased on this condition, a dimensionless criterion has been suggested earlier\nby Kuo and Ford for drawing the limits on the validity of this semiclassical\ntheory. In this paper, we examine this criterion for the case of a toy model,\nconstructed with two degrees of freedom and a coupling between them that\nexactly mimics the behaviour of a scalar field in a Friedmann universe. To\nreproduce the semiclassical regime of the field theory, in the toy model, one\nof degrees of freedom is assumed to be classical and the other quantum\nmechanical. Also the backreaction is assumed to be given by the expectation\nvalues of the quantum operators involved in the equations of motion for the\nclassical system. Motivated by the same physical reasoning as Kuo and Ford, we,\nhere, suggest another criterion, one which will be shown to perform more\nreliably as we evaluate these criterions for different states of the quantum\nsystem in the toy model. Finally, from the results obtained we conclude that\nthe semiclassical theory being considered for the toy model is reliable, during\nall stages of its evolution, only if the quantum system is specified to be in\ncoherent like states.

We give a class\nof Hopf algebroids associated to module algebras of the Drinfeld doubles of\nHopf algebras when the $R$-matrices act properly. When this construction is\napplied to quantum groups, we get examples of quantum groupoids, which are\nsemi-classical limits of Poisson groupoids. The example of quantum $sl(2)$ is\nworked out in details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 1995 17:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
