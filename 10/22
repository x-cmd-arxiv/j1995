The current oscillations are caused by the\nmotion and recycling of the domain wall separating low- and high-electric-\nfield regions of the superlattice, as the analysis of a discrete drift model\nshows and experimental evidence supports. Numerical simulation shows that\ndifferent nonlinear dynamical regimes of the domain wall appear when an\nexternal microwave signal is superimposed on the dc bias and its driving\nfrequency and driving amplitude vary. On the frequency - amplitude parameter\nplane, there are regions of entrainment and quasiperiodicity forming Arnol'd\ntongues. Chaos is demonstrated to appear at the boundaries of the tongues and\nin the regions where they overlap. Coexistence of up to four electric-field\ndomains randomly nucleated in space is detected under ac+dc driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 1995 06:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
