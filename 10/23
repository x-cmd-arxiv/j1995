We\nconsidered two cases: a strong magnetic field (Alfven Mach number, M_a = 2.5)\nand a weak field (M_a =5). Each flow rapidly evolves until it reaches a nearly\nsteady condition, which is fundamentally different from the analogous\ngasdynamic state. Both MHD flows relax to a stable, laminar flow on timescales\nless than or of the order of 15 linear growth times, measured from saturation\nof the instability. That timescale is several orders of magnitude less than the\nnominal dissipation time for these simulated flows, so this condition\nrepresents an quasi-steady relaxed state. The strong magnetic field case\nreaches saturation as magnetic tension in the displaced flow boundary becomes\nsufficient to stabilize it. That flow then relaxes in a straightforward way to\nthe steady, laminar flow condition. The weak magnetic field case, on the other\nhand, begins development of the vortex expected for gasdynamics, but that\nvortex is destroyed by magnetic stresses that locally become strong. Magnetic\ntopologies lead to reconnection and dynamical alignment between magnetic and\nvelocity fields. Together these processes produce a sequence of intermittent\nvortices and subsequent relaxation to a nearly laminar flow condition in which\nthe magnetic cross helicity is nearly maximized. Remaining irregularities\nconsist of a pair of flux tubes straddling the shear layer. Fluctuations within\nthose features are closely aligned, representing Alfv\\'en waves propagating\nlocally downstream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 1995 13:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The calculations\nare done for $\\beta$--stable nuclear matter with and without muons. We find\nmuons to appear at densities $\\rho = 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$, slightly around the\nsaturation density for nuclear matter $\\rho_0 =0.16$ fm$^{-3}$. The direct URCA\nprocesses for nucleons are forbidden for densities below $\\rho = 0.5$\nfm$^{-3}$, however the modified URCA processes with muons $(n+N\\rightarrow p+N\n+\\mu +\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}, p+N+\\mu \\rightarrow n+N+\\nu_{\\mu}$), where $N$ is a\nnucleon, result in neutrino emissivities comparable to those from\n$(n+N\\rightarrow p+N +e +\\overline{\\nu}_e, p+N+e \\rightarrow n+N+\\nu_e$). This\nopens up for further possibilities to explain the rapid cooling of neutrons\nstars. Superconducting protons reduce however these emissivities at densities\nbelow $0.4$ fm$^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 1995 07:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
