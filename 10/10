Using a hierarchical tree gravity\nsolver combined with a sticky-particle gas dissipation scheme for our\nsimulations, we have investigated three mechanisms: episodic and continuous gas\ninfall, and a merger with a gas-rich dwarf galaxy. We find that both episodic\nand continuous gas infall work reasonably well and are able to produce a\nsubstantial gas counterrotating disk without upsetting the stability of the\nexisting disk drastically, but it is very important for the gas to be\nwell-dispersed in phase-space and not form concentrated clumps prior to its\nabsorption by the disk galaxy. The initial angular momentum of the gas also\nplays a crucial role in determining the scale length of the counterrotating\ndisk formed and the time it takes to form. The rate of infall, i.e. the mass of\ngas falling in per unit time, has to be small enough to preclude excessive\nheating of the preexisting disk. It is much easier in general to produce a\nsmaller counterrotating disk than it is to produce an extensive disk whose\nscale length is similar to that of the original prograde disk.\n  A gas-rich dwarf merger does not appear to be a viable mechanism to produce a\nmassive counterrotating disk, because only a very small dwarf galaxy can\nproduce a counterrotating disk without increasing the thickness of the existing\ndisk by an order of magnitude, and the time-scale for this process is\nprohibitively long because it makes it very unlikely that several such mergers\ncan accumulate a massive counterrotating disk over a Hubble time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 1995 22:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
