This shear field most likely\narises from gravitational lensing of distant field galaxies by a foreground\nmass concentration. In the light of previous observations of this region, which\nindicate the presence of a rich cluster around the radio source, we suggest\nthat the most likely candidate for the lens is the cluster associated with the\nradio galaxy at z=1.2. If so, this is the most distant cluster to have been\ndetected by weak shear observations. Such a statement has two important\nconsequences. Firstly, it shows that massive, collapsed structures exist in the\nhigh redshift Universe, and secondly that a significant fraction of the\nR=24.5-27.5 field galaxy population lies beyond z=1.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 1995 23:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
