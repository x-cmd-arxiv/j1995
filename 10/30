The interior\nvelocity dispersion correlates with mass, again in good agreement with the\nspherical collapse model. Interior to the virial radius r_178, the spherical\naveraged density, circular velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are well\nfit by a simple 2-parameter analytic model proposed by Navarro etal (1995).\nThis model has density going as 1/r at small radii, steepening to 1/r^3 at\nlarge radii, and fits our haloes to the resolution limit of the simulations.\nThe two model parameters, scalelength and mass, are tightly correlated. Lower\nmass haloes are more centrally concentrated, and so have scalelengths which are\na smaller fraction of their virial radius than those of their higher mass\ncounterparts. This reflects the earlier formation times of low mass haloes. The\nhaloes are moderately aspherical, with typical axial ratios 1:0.8:0.65 at their\nvirial radii. These shapes are maintained by an anisotropic velocity dispersion\ntensor. The median value of the spin parameter is lambda=0.04, with a weak\ntrend for lower lambda at higher halo mass.

Conventional discrete approximations, however,\ncannot capture all aspects of the original manifold, notably its topology. In\nthis paper we discuss an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which correctly\nreproduces important topological aspects of continuum physics. The\napproximating topological spaces are partially ordered sets (posets), the\npartial order encoding the topology. Now, the topology of a manifold $M$ can be\nreconstructed from the commutative C*-algebra $\\cc(M)$ of continuous functions\ndefined on it. In turn, this algebra is generated by continuous probability\ndensities in ordinary quantum physics on $M$. The latter also serve to specify\nthe domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset, the role of this\nalgebra is assumed by a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra $\\ca $. This fact makes\nany poset a genuine `noncommutative' (`quantum') space, in the sense that the\nalgebra of its `continuous functions' is a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra. We\ntherefore also have a remarkable connection between finite approximations to\nquantum physics and noncommutative geometries.
