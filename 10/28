Our\nconditions $W$ and $W^*$ contain the non-metric small cancellation cases C(6),\nC(4)T(4), C(3)T(6) (see [LS]) but are considerably more general. $W$ also\ncontains as a special case the small cancellation condition $W(6)$ of Juhasz\n[J2]. If a finite presentation satisfies $W$ or $W^*$ then it has a quadratic\nisoperimetric inequality and therefore solvable word problem. For the class $W$\nthis was first observed by Gersten in [G7] which also contains an idea of the\nproof. Our main result here is the proof of the conjugacy problem for the\nclasses $W$ and $W^*$ which uses the geometry of non-positively curved\npiecewise Euclidean complexes developed by Bridson in [Bri]. The conditions $V$\nand $V^*$ generalize the small cancellation conditions C(7), C(5)T(4),\nC(4)T(5), C(3)T(7). If a finite presentation satisfies the condition $V$ or\n$V^*$, then it has a linear isoperimetric inequality and hence the group is\nhyperbolic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 1995 15:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

After the\npreequilibrium stage, which lasts for approximately 4 (2) fm/c in Pb+Pb (S+S)\nthe source stays in approximate kinetic equilibrium for about 2 fm/c at a\ntemperature close to 140 MeV. The interactions of mesons last until around 14\n(5) fm/c during which time strong transverse flow is generated. The\ninteractions in the hadronic resonance gas are not sufficiently strong to\nmaintain ideal fluid expansion. While pions acquire average transverse fluid\nvelocities around 0.47-0.58 c, heavier particles like protons and kaons cannot\nkeep up with the pionic fluid, since their average velocities are smaller by\nabout 20 to 30 \\%. Although kinetic equilibrium breaks down in the final dilute\nstage of $AA$ collisions, the system resembles a thermal system at a\ntemperature of 130 MeV, if the free streaming of hadrons after freeze-out is\nsuppressed. This freeze-out temperature is consistent with estimates based on\nmean free paths and expansion rates in a thermal fireball but lower than values\nderived from fits to measured particle ratios and transverse momentum spectra.\nThe processes in RQMD to which the differences can be attributed to are the\nnon-ideal expansion of the hadronic matter and the absence of chemical\nequilibrium at freeze-out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 1995 20:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The reaction allows for the study of the\nproduction process in the nuclear medium without being obscured by the details\nof nuclear transition densities. First, a pion electroproduction operator\nsuitable for nuclear calculations is obtained by extending the Blomqvist-Laget\nphotoproduction operator to the virtual photon case. The operator is gauge\ninvariant, unitary, reference frame independent, and describes the existing\ndata reasonably well. Then it is applied in nuclei to predict nuclear cross\nsections under a variety of kinematic arrangements. Issues such as the effects\nof gauge-fixing, the interference of the $\\Delta$ resonance with the\nbackground, sensitivities to the quadrupole component of the $\\Delta$\nexcitation and to the electromagnetic form factors, the role of final-state\ninteractions, are studied in detail.
