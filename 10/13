We\npresent a new way to calculate mass-loss rates from the OH-maser emission. We\nfind no evidence for a correlation of the mass-loss rates with luminosity in\nthese obscured stars. Neither do the mass-loss rates for the LMC and SMC stars\ndiffer in any clear systematic way from each other.

During an electron trapping process, a hot electron may be\ndeposited in a quantum dot or metal island, with an extra energy usually on the\norder of the Coulomb charging energy, which is much higher than the temperature\nin typical experiments. The hot electron may relax through three channels:\ntunneling back and forth to the feeding lead (or island), emitting phonons, and\nexciting background electrons. Depending on the magnitudes of the rates in the\nlatter two channels relative to the device operation frequency and to each\nother, the system may be in one of three different regimes: equilibrium,\nnon-equilibrium, and self heating (partial equilibrium). In the quilibrium\nregime, a hot electron fully gives up its energy to phonons within a pump\ncycle. In the nonequilibrium regime, the relaxation is via tunneling with a\ndistribution of characteristic rates; the approach to equilibrium goes like a\npower law of time (frequency) instead of an exponential. This channel is\nplagued completely in the continuum limit of the single electron levels. In the\nself heating regime, the hot electron thermalizes quickly with background\nelectrons, whose temperature $T_e$ is elevated above the lattice temperature\n$T_l$. We have calculated the coefficient in the well known $T^5$ law of energy\ndissipation rate, and compared the results to experimental values for aluminum\nand copper islands and for a two dimensional semiconductor quantum dot.\nMoreover, we have obtained different scaling relations between the electron\ntemperature and operation frequency and device size for various types of\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 1995 16:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 1995 01:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The Born effective charges are found to\nincrease nearly linearly with decreasing volume down to the smallest volume\nstudied, $V/V_0=0.78$, corresponding to a pressure of about 0.8 Mbar. This\nseems to be in contradiction with the conclusion of the turnover behavior\nrecently reported by Liu and Vohra [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ {\\bf 72}, 4105 (1994)]\nfor $6H$-SiC. Reanalyzing their procedure to extract the pressure dependence of\nthe Born effective charges, we suggest that the turnover behavior they obtained\nis due to approximations in the assumed pressure dependence of the dielectric\nconstant $\\varepsilon_\\infty$, the use of a singular set of experimental data\nfor the equation of state, and the uncertainty in measured phonon frequencies,\nespecially at high pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 1995 03:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The\nincrease in binding energy can be clearly attributed to the off-shell behavior\nof the non-local potential.

We use a static kernel consisting of a one-gluon-exchange component\nand a confining contribution. Salpeter's equation is known to be formally\nequivalent to a random-phase-approximation equation; as such, it can develop\nimaginary eigenvalues. Thus, our study can not be complete without first\ndiscussing the stability of Salpeter's equation. The stability analysis limits\nthe form of the kernel and reveals that, contrary to the usual assumption, the\nconfining component can not transform as a Lorentz scalar; it must transform as\nthe timelike component of a vector. Moreover, the stability analysis sets an\nupper limit on the size of the one-gluon-exchange component; the value for the\ncritical coupling is determined through a solution of the ``semirelativistic''\nCoulomb problem. These limits place important constraints on the interaction\nand suggest that a more sophisticated model is needed to describe the light and\nheavy quarkonia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 1995 19:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
