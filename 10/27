First, we present a derivation of quark\nconfining interaction in light-front QCD for heavy quark systems, based on the\nrecently developed light-front similarity renormalization group approach and\nthe light-front heavy quark effective theory. The resulting effective\nlight-front QCD Hamiltonian $H_\\lambda$ at a low-energy cutoff $\\lambda$\nmanifests the coexistence of a confining potential and a Coulomb potential. A\nclear light-front picture of quark confinement emerges. Using this low energy\nQCD Hamiltonian $H_\\lambda$, we study heavy hadron bound state equations in the\nframework of a recently proposed possible weak-coupling treatment of\nnon-perturbative QCD. Light-front heavy hadron bound states with definite spin\nand parity are constructed and the general structure of the corresponding\nwavefunctions is explored. A Gaussian-type wavefunction ansatz is used to solve\nthe light-front quarkonium bound state equation. We find that the effective\ncoupling constant determined from the quarkonium bound state equation can be\narbitrarily small so that the weak-coupling treatment to heavy hadron bound\nstates in light-front QCD is explicitly achieved. Finally, the scale dependence\nof the effective coupling constant is analytically calculated and the\nsimilarity renormalization group $\\beta$ function is determined, from which the\nrunning coupling constant in small momentum transfer is given qualitatively by\n$\\overline{\\alpha}(Q^2) \\sim {\\Lambda_{QCD}^2 \\over Q^2}$.

The search was guided by a\nmass formula for strange quark nuggets which suggested that stable strange\nhelium might exist at a mass around 65 u. The chemical similarity of such\n``strangelets'' to noble gas atoms and the gravitational unboundedness of\nnormal helium result in a large enhancement in the sensitivity of such a\nsearch. An abundance limit of no more than $2 \\cdot 10^{-11}$ strangelets per\nnormal nucleus is imposed by our search over a mass region from 42 to 82 u,\nwith much more stringent limits at most (non-integer) masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 1995 19:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 1995 17:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The\ncollective variable is parameterized as a shape degree of freedom and the mean\nfield is approximated by a deformed shell model potential. We concentrate on\nsituations of slow motion, as guaranteed, for instance, by the presence of a\nstrong friction force, which allows us to apply linear response theory. The\nprediction for nuclear dissipation of some models of internal motion are\ncontrasted. They encompass such opposing cases as that of pure independent\nparticle motion and the one of \"collisional dominance\". For the former the wall\nformula appears as the macroscopic limit, which is here simulated through\nStrutinsky smoothing procedures. It is argued that this limit hardly applies to\nthe actual nuclear situation. The reason is found in large collisional damping\npresent for nucleonic dynamics at finite temperature $T$. The level structure\nof the mean field as well as the $T$-dependence of collisional damping\ndetermine the $T$-dependence of friction. Two contributions are isolated, one\ncoming from real transitions, the other being associated to what for infinite\nmatter is called the \"heat pole\". The importance of the latter depends strongly\non the level spectrum of internal motion, and thus is very different for\n\"adiabatic\" and \"diabatic\" situations, both belonging to different degrees of\n\"ergodicity\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 1995 13:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 1995 09:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
