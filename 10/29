The complete phase diagram is obtained and it is found\nthat a new frozen phase, in which the attracting dimers prevail, arises when\nthe interaction is attractive. For repulsive dimer interactions a new\nfirst-order line separating two frozen phases occurs.

For both the Ising and dual Ising theories the results on the\nsphere are in agreement with the KPZ/DDK scaling predictions based on Liouville\ntheory; the results on the disk agree with the scaling predictions of Martinec,\nMoore, and Seiberg for boundary operators. The calculation of Ising disorder\ncorrelations on the sphere requires the use of boundary variables introduced in\n[hep-th/9510199], which have no matrix model analog. A subtlety in the\ncalculation on the disk arises because the expansions of the correlation\nfunctions have leading singular terms which are nonuniversal; we show that this\nissue may be resolved by using separate cosmological constants for each\nboundary domain. These results give evidence that the Kramers-Wannier duality\nsymmetry of the $c = 1/2$ conformal field theory survives coupling to quantum\ngravity, implying a duality symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ string even in the\npresence of boundary operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 1995 00:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 1995 03:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 1996 23:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Nuclear radii, isotope shifts and\ndeformation properties of the heavier rare-earth nuclei have been obtained,\nwhich encompass atomic numbers ranging from Z=60 to Z=70 and include a large\nrange of isospin. It is shown that RMF theory is able to provide a good and\ncomprehensive description of the empirical binding energies of the isotopic\nchains. At the same time the quadrupole deformations $\\beta_{2}$ obtained in\nthe RMF theory are found to be in good agreement with the available empirical\nvalues. The theory predicts a shape transition from prolate to oblate for\nnuclei at neutron number N=78 in all the chains. A further addition of neutrons\nup to the magic number 82 brings about the spherical shape. For nuclei above\nN=82, the RMF theory predicts the well-known onset of prolate deformation at\nabout N=88, which saturates at about N=102. The deformation properties display\nan identical behaviour for all the nuclear chains. A good description of the\nabove deformation transitions in the RMF theory in all the isotopic chains\nleads to a successful reproduction of the anomalous behaviour of the empirical\nisotopic shifts of the rare-earth nuclei. The RMF theory exhibits a remarkable\nsuccess in providing a unified and microscopic description of various empirical\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 1995 12:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
