It has been known for some time that the\nexcessive number of blue galaxies counted at faint magnitudes implies that a\nconsiderable fraction of the massive star formation in the universe occurred at\nz < 3, but, surprisingly, spectroscopic studies of galaxies down to a B\nmagnitude of 24 found little sign of the expected high-z progenitors of current\nmassive galaxies, but rather, in large part, small blue galaxies at modest\nredshifts z \\sim 0.3. This unexpected population has diverted attention from\nthe possibility that early massive star-forming galaxies might also be found in\nthe faint blue excess. From KECK spectroscopic observations deep enough to\nencompass a large population of z > 1 field galaxies, we can now show directly\nthat in fact these forming galaxies are present in substantial numbers at B\n\\sim 24, and that the era from redshifts 1 to 2 was clearly a major period of\ngalaxy formation.

Using the Zel'dovich approximation, we obtain an analytic\nexpression for the nonlinear redshift space power spectrum in the distant\nobserver limit. For a given unbiased galaxy distribution in redshift space, the\nanisotropies in the power spectrum depend on the parameter $f(\\Omega)\\approx\n\\Omega^{0.6}$, where $\\Omega$ is the density parameter. We quantify these\nanisotropies by the ratio, $R$, of the quadrupole to monopole angular moments\nof the power spectrum. In contrast to linear theory, the Zel'dovich\napproximation predicts a decline in $R$ with decreasing scale. This departure\nfrom linear theory is due to nonlinear dynamics and not a result of incoherent\nrandom velocities. The rate of decline depends strongly on $\\Omega$ and the\ninitial power spectrum. However, we find a {\\it universal} relation between the\nquantity $R/R_{lin}$ (where $R_{lin}$ the linear theory value of $R$) and the\ndimensionless variable $k/k_{nl}$, where $k_{nl}$ is a wavenumber determined by\nthe scale of nonlinear structures. The universal relation is in good agreement\nwith a large N-body simulation. This universal relation greatly extends the\nscales over which redshift distortions can be used as a probe of $\\Omega$. A\npreliminary application to the 1.2 Jy IRAS yields $\\Omega\\sim 0.4$ if IRAS\ngalaxies are unbiased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 1995 15:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}
