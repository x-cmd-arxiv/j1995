To investigate\nthe structure and stability of high coverage oxygen structures, we performed\ndensity functional theory calculations, within the generalized gradient\napproximation, for O adlayers on Ru(0001) from low coverage up to a full\nmonolayer. We achieve quantitative agreement with previous low energy electron\ndiffraction intensity analyses for the (2x2) and (2x1) phases and predict that\nan O adlayer with a (1x1) periodicity and coverage of 1 monolayer can form on\nRu(0001), where the O adatoms occupy hcp-hollow sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 1995 13:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In addition we also\nconsider effects from rho-meson renormalization in the nucleus. The use of\nnucleon Green's functions in terms of their spectral functions offers a precise\nway to account for Fermi motion and binding. On the other hand the use of many\nbody Feynman diagrams in a relativistic framework allows one to avoid using\nprescriptions given in the past to introduce relativistic corrections in a non\nrelativistic formalism. We show that with realistic nucleon spectral functions\nand meson nucleus selfenergies one can get a reasonable description of the EMC\neffect for x > 0.15, outside the shadowing region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 1995 08:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 1996 12:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
