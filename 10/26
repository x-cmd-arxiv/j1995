Most\ncalculations of electromagnetic radiation from strong interaction processes\nrely on the soft photon approximation (SPA). The conditions underlying this\napproximation are generally violated when dilepton spectra are calculated in\nterms of their invariant mass, so that an approach going beyond the SPA becomes\nnecessary. Superseding previous derivations, we derive an exact formula for the\nbremsstrahlung cross section. The resulting formulation is compared to various\nforms based on the SPA, the two-particle phase space approximation and\nR\\\"uckl's formula using a relativistic One Boson Exchange (OBE) model. Within\nthe OBE approach, we show that approximations to the bremsstrahlung dilepton\ncross sections often differ greatly from the exact result; discrepancies become\ngreater both with rising temperature and with invariant mass. Integrated\ndilepton production rates are overestimated by R\\\"uckl-based approximations by\nfactors 1.5--8.0.
