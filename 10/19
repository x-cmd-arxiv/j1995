Special attention\nis addressed to the problem of the formation of unphysical states in the mapped\nspace. A correspondence is established between quark and baryon spaces and the\nbaryon image of a generic quark operator is defined both in its Hermitian and\nnon-Hermitian forms. Its spectrum (identical in the two cases) is found to\nconsist of a physical part containing the same eigenvalues of the quark\noperator in the cluster space and an unphysical part consisting only of zero\neigenvalues. A physical subspace of the baryon space is also defined where the\nlatter eigenvalues are suppressed. The procedure discussed is quite general and\napplications of it can be thought also in the correspondence between systems of\n2n fermions and n bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 1995 11:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
