A\ncomprehensive theory of avalanche dynamics in models of growth, interface\ndepinning, and evolution is presented.

The\nformation of fractal structures, the appearance of $1/f$ noise, diffusion with\nanomalous Hurst exponents, Levy flights, and punctuated equilibria can all be\nrelated to the same underlying avalanche dynamics. This dynamics can be\nrepresented as a fractal in $d$ spatial plus one temporal dimension. We develop\na scaling theory that relates many of the critical exponents in this broad\ncategory of extremal models, representing different universality classes, to\ntwo basic exponents characterizing the fractal attractor. The exact equations\nand the derived set of scaling relations are consistent with numerical\nsimulations of the above mentioned models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 1995 16:12:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 1995 19:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
