If spacetime is simply connected (which is assumed\nin this paper), the non-trivial homology occurs in dimension two, and spacetime\ncan be regarded as being essentially the topological sum of $S^2\\times S^2$ and\n$K3$ bubbles. Comparison with the instantons for pair creation of black holes\nshows that the $S^2\\times S^2$ bubbles can be interpreted as closed loops of\nvirtual black holes. It is shown that scattering in such topological\nfluctuations leads to loss of quantum coherence, or in other words, to a\nsuperscattering matrix $\\$ $ that does not factorise into an $S$ matrix and its\nadjoint. This loss of quantum coherence is very small at low energies for\neverything except scalar fields, leading to the prediction that we may never\nobserve the Higgs particle. Another possible observational consequence may be\nthat the $\\theta $ angle of QCD is zero without having to invoke the\nproblematical existence of a light axion. The picture of virtual black holes\ngiven here also suggests that macroscopic black holes will evaporate down to\nthe Planck size and then disappear in the sea of virtual black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 1995 15:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
