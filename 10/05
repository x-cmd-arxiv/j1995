We give an example for which a\ndirect solution at thermal accuracy is nontrivial and for which Gauss-Seidel\niteration diverges in rare but reproducible cases. This difficulty is analyzed\nby obtaining the eigenvalues and the spectral radius of the iteration matrix.\nThis establishes that the nonconvergence is due to inaccuracies of the\nasymptotic approximations for the matrix elements for accidentally close\nboundary element pairs on different spheres. This difficulty is cured by\nchecking for boundary element pairs closer than the typical spatial extent of\nthe boundary elements and for those pairs performing an `in-line' Monte Carlo\nintegration to evaluate the required matrix elements. This difficulty are not\nexpected and have not been observed when only a direct solution is sought.\nFinally, we give an example application of these methods to deprotonation of\nmonosilicic acid in water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 1995 21:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
