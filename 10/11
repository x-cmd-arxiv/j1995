We consider the effect of inhomogeneities on the average\nexpansion and discuss under which circumstances the standard description of the\naverage motion in terms of Friedmann's equation holds. We find that this effect\nvanishes for spatially compact models if one averages over the whole space. For\nspatially infinite inhomogeneous models obeying the cosmological principle of\nlarge--scale isotropy and homogeneity, Friedmann models may provide an\napproximation to the average motion on the largest scales, whereas for\nhierarchical (Charlier--type) models the general expansion equation shows how\ninhomogeneities might appreciably affect the expansion at all scales. An\naveraged vorticity evolution law is also given. Since we employ spatial\naveraging, the problem of justifying ensemble averaging does not arise. A\ngeneralization of the expansion law to general relativity is straightforward\nfor the case of irrotational flows and will be discussed. The effect may have\nimportant consequences for a variety of problems in large--scale structure\nmodeling as well as for the interpretation of observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 1995 17:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 1996 10:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 1996 13:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

In QCD\nthe nonlinear chromodynamical field between a quark and an antiquark is\nconfined to a tube. So we assume that there is the strong interaction between\nphonons which can confine them to some tube too. This tube is described using\nthe nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We show that it has an infinite spectrum\nof axially symmetric (string) solutions with negative finite linear energy\ndensity. The one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation has a finite\nspectrum (hence, it has a steady-state) which describes the Cooper pair\nsquezeed between anisotropy planes in the superconductor. It is shown that in\nthis model the transition temperature is approximately 45 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 1995 10:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 1995 10:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 1996 06:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
