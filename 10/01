What was then technically\nimpossible has now become feasible thanks to modern advances such as Miller's\nproof of the Sullivan conjecture and Lannes's division functors. Today, with\nDwyer and Wilkerson's implementation of Rector's vision, the tantalizing\nclassification theorem seems to be within grasp. Supported by motivating\nexamples and clarifying exercises, this guide quickly leads, without ignoring\nthe context or the proof strategy, from classical finite loop spaces to the\nimportant definitions and striking results of this new theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
