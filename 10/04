The required intrinsic absorbing column density is two to three\norders of magnitude larger than earlier estimates of column densities in\nBALQSOs.

Inflationary models are of this kind as they focus on simple\nscalar field scenarios with correspondingly simple dynamics. However, we can be\nassured that the universe is crowded with many interacting fields of which the\ninflaton is but one. As we describe, the nonlinear nature of these interactions\ncan result in a complex, chaotic evolution of the universe. Here we illustrate\nhow chaotic effects can arise even in basic models such as homogeneous,\nisotropic universes with two scalar fields. We find inflating universes which\nact as attractors in the space of initial conditions. These universes display\nchaotic transients in their early evolution. The chaotic character is reflected\nby the fractal border to the basin of attraction. The broader implications are\nlikely to be felt in the process of reheating as well as in the nature of the\ncosmic background radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 1995 23:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 1996 12:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

A numerical algorithm involving nested subgrids is used to resolve\nthe region where fragmentation occurs in the central part of the protostar. A\nprevious calculation by Boss, which produced a hierarchical multiple system, is\nevolved further, at comparable numerical resolution, and the end result is a\nbinary, with more than half of the mass of the original cloud, whose orbital\nseparation increases with time as a result of accretion of high-angular\nmomentum material and as a result of merging with fragments that have formed\nfarther out. Repeating the calculation with significantly higher resolution, we\nfind that a sequence of binaries can be induced by fragmentation of\ncircumbinary disks. The stability of the resulting multiple system is\ninvestigated Using $n$-body calculations, which indicate that such a system\nwould transform on a short time scale into a more stable hierarchical\nstructure. The outermost and most massive binary which forms in the\nhigh-resolution run has properties similar to that of the binary found in the\nlow-resolution calculation. Thus the basic outcome is shown to be independent\nof the numerical spatial resolution. The high-resolution run, in addition,\nleads to the formation of a system of smaller fragments, which might be\nimportant for the understanding of the origin of close binaries with low-mass\ncomponents and of low mass single stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 1995 21:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The creation operators of the strings are\nexplicitly constructed in the path integral and in the Hamiltonian formulation\nof the theory. We show that the Aharonov--Bohm effect gives rise to several\nnontrivial commutation relations. We also study the Aharonov--Bohm effect in\nthe lattice formulation of the Abelian Higgs Model. It occurs that this effect\ngives rise to a nontrivial interaction of tested charged particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 1995 13:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 1995 18:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
