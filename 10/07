For this purpose, a\nset of relativistic Lagrangian equations describing the evolution of the\nstrongly interacting fluids is coupled to a system of equivalent equations\naccounting for the hydrodynamics of the fluid of electromagnetically\ninteracting particles. The complete set of equations has then been solved\nnumerically and results are presented from this. The inclusion of relativistic\nradiative transfer produces significantly different results, with the formation\nof high density regions at the end of the drop evaporation being particularly\nrelevant.

This model can be considered as belonging to the class of\nself-organized models which may exhibit spontaneous criticality, with four\nadditional ingredients compared to sandpile models, namely quenched disorder,\nboundary driving, long range forces and fast time crack rules. In this\n''crack'' model, as in the ''dislocation'' version previously studied, we find\nthat the occurrence of repeated earthquakes organizes the activity on\nwell-defined fault-like structures. In contrast with the ''dislocation'' model,\nafter a transient, the time evolution becomes periodic with run-aways ending\neach cycle. This stems from the ''crack'' stress transfer rule preventing\ncriticality to organize in favor of cyclic behavior.

To make this equation and the relevant hamiltonian\nstructures more tractable, we reformulate it in the ordinary $N=4$ and further\nin $N=2$ superspaces. In $N=2$ superspace it is given by a coupled system of\nevolution equations for a general $N=2$ superfield and two chiral and\nantichiral superfields, and involves two independent real parameters, $a$ and\n$b$. We construct a few first bosonic conserved charges in involution, of\ndimensions from 1 to 6, and show that they exist only for the following choices\nof the parameters: (i) $a= 4, \\;b=0$; (ii) $a= -2,\\; b= -6$; (iii) $a= -2, \\;b=\n6$. The same values are needed for the relevant evolution equations to be\nbi-hamiltonian. We demonstrate that these three options are related via $SU(2)$\ntransformations and actually amount to the $SU(2)$ covariant integrability\ncondition found in the harmonic superspace approach. Our results provide a\nstrong evidence that the unique $N=4$ $SU(2)$ super KdV hierarchy exists. Upon\nreduction to $N=2$ KdV, the above three possibilities cease to be equivalent.\nThey give rise to the $a=4$ and $a=-2$ $N=2$ KdV hierarchies, which thus prove\nto be different truncations of the single $N=4$ $SU(2)$ KdV one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 1995 22:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 1995 01:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
