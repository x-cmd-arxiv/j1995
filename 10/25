Applying our procedure to Perseus then Coma, we find that the\nimprovement of the observational constraints results in a quite modest\nimprovement in the accuracy of the mass estimate.

Samples of elemental sulfur enriched in $^{36}$S by 5.933 %\nwere irradiated between two gold foils which served as capture standards. The\ncapture cross section was measured at the neutron energies 25, 151, 176, and\n218 keV, respectively. The $^{36}S(n,\\gamma)^{37}S$-cross section in the\nthermonuclear and thermal energy range has been calculated using the\ndirect-capture (DC) model combined with the folding procedure used for the\ndetermination of the potentials. The non-resonant experimental data for this\nreaction can be reproduced excellently using this method. The input parameters\nof the DC-calculation (masses, Q-values, nuclear density distributions,\nspectroscopic factors, spin-parity assignments and excitation energies of the\nlow-lying states of the residual nucleus) have been taken from the available\nexperimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 1995 17:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 1995 16:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A comprehensive analysis of\nground state rho-meson and nucleon spectral properties is performed. Many of\nthe findings contradict the conventional wisdom of both practitioners and\nskeptics alike. Associations between the phenomenological fit parameters are\nparticularly interesting as they reveal how the sum rules resolve the spectral\nproperties. The use of derivative sum rules for the determination of rho-meson\nspectral properties is shown to be a very unfavorable approach. Most prior\nnucleon sum rule analyses are based on a sum rule which is found to be invalid;\nthe results are suspect, and should be reevaluated. The ``Ioffe formula'',\nargued by many to qualitatively encapsulate a description of the nucleon mass\nin terms of the chiral symmetry breaking order parameter is misleading at best.\nQCD Sum Rules are found to be self-consistent without contributions from direct\ninstantons. This implies that instanton effects are adequately accounted for in\nthe nonperturbative vacuum condensates. This in-depth examination of QCD sum\nrule self consistency paints a favorable picture for further quantitative\nrefinements of the QCD sum rule approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 1995 18:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 1996 22:57:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 1996 17:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}
