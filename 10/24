At zero temperature in (3+1) dimensions the\nnucleation rate is dominated by the O(4) symmetric instanton, a sphere of\nradius $R$, while at temperatures $T >> R^{-1}$, the decay is dominated by a\n``cylindrical'' (static) instanton wtih O(3) invariance. There has been\ndiscussion in the literature as to whether the transition between these two\nregimens would be first order (discontinuity in the first derivative of the\nnucleation rate at the transition temperature $T_{c}$), or second order\n(continuity of the first derivative, but discontinuity of the second derivative\nat $T_{c}$). In this paper we obtain the finite temperature solutions\ncorresponding to the quantum and the thermal regimes, and compute their action\nas a function of the temperature for different values of the wall thickness in\na $\\varphi^{4}$ potential. Our results indicate that only for the cases of very\nlarge wall thickness a second order transition takes place, while for all the\nother cases a first order transition occurs\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 1995 07:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
