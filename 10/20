In this work the construction of p-adic\nfield theory limit of Quantum TGD is considered. Topological condensate defined\nas a manifold obtained by gluing together p-adic spacetime regions with\ndifferent values of $p$ is identified as 'quantum average' space time defined\nas absolute minimum of effective action $S_e$ associated with K\\\"ahler Dirac\naction defining configuration space geometry. p-Adic spacetime topology is\nultrametric in accordance with the analogy with spin glass phase implied by the\nvacuum degenerary of K\\\"ahler action. Symmetry arguments suggest that $S_e$ in\npresence of fermion fields is just the super symmetrized K\\\"ahler Dirac action.\nSuper symmetrization motivated by $N=1$ super symmetry generated by right\nhanded neutrino replaces H-coordinates with their super counterparts and\nrequires color singletness of physical states appears as consistency condition.\np-Adic $Diff(M^4)$ and canonical transformations of $CP_2$ localized with\nrespect to $M^4$ are approximate symmetries of the effective action and broken\nonly by the nonflatness of the induced metric. Super gauge invariances in\ninterior allow only massless many boson states with vanishing electroweak and\ncolor quantum numbers including graviton in accordance with the hypothesis that\nelementary particle quantum numbers reside on boundaries. Boundary components\nare idealized with world lines and Kac Moody Dirac spinors used in mass\ncalculations describe the conformal degrees of freedom of the boundary\ncomponent. Perturbation theory in powers of $p$ converges extremely rapidly: UV\ndivergences are absent but natural infrared cutoff is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 1995 10:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
