We exhibit the maximum size of the domain\nfor which the vortex street is stable. By adapting a numerical time-stepping\ncode, we calculate the linear stability of the Mallier-Maslowe solution in the\npresence of viscosity and compensating forcing. Finally, the results are\ndiscussed and compared to a recent experiment in fluids performed by Tabeling\net al.~[Europhysics Letters {\\bf 3}, 459 (1987)]. Electromagnetically driven\ncounter-rotating vortices are unstable above a critical electric current, and\ngive way to co-rotating vortices.
