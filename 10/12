We find that the 0.4 - 10 keV\nspectrum of IC 4329A is best described by the sum of a steep ($\\Gamma \\sim\n1.98$) power-law spectrum passing through a warm absorber plus a strong\nreflection component and associated Fe K line, confirming recent results\n(Madejski et al. 1995, Mushotsky et al. 1995). Further cold absorption in\nexcess of the Galactic value and covering the entire source is also required by\nthe data, consistent with the edge-on galactic disk and previous X-ray\nmeasurements. The effect of the warm absorber at soft X-ray energies is best\nparameterized by two absorption edges, one consistent with OVI, OVII or NVII,\nthe other consistent with OVIII. A description of the soft excess in terms of\nblackbody emission, as observed in some other Seyfert 1 galaxies, is ruled out\nby the data. A large amount of reflection is detected in both the GIS and SIS\ndetectors, at similar intensities. We find a strong correlation between the\namount of reflection and the photon index, but argue that the best solution\nwith the present data is that given by the best statistical fit. The model\ndependence of the Fe K line parameters is also discussed. Our best fit gives a\nslightly broad ($\\sigma \\simeq 0.11 \\pm 0.08$ keV) and redshifted (E $\\simeq\n6.20 \\pm 0.07$ keV) Fe K line, with equivalent width $\\simeq$ 89 $\\pm$ 33 eV.\nThe presence of a weak Fe K line with a strong reflection can be reconciled if\none assumes iron underabundances or ionized reflection. We also have modeled\nthe line with a theoretical line profile produced by an accretion disk. This\nyields results in better agreement with the constraints obtained from the\nreflection component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 1995 09:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
