To this end, we apply a Quadratic Programming method. Constant\nmass-to-light ratio models fail to reproduce the major axis velocity dispersion\nmeasurements at large radii: the profile of this kind of models falls off too\nsteeply when compared to the observations, clearly suggesting the necessity of\nincluding a dark component in the halo. By assuming a mass-to-light ratio which\nis increasing with radius, the model satisfactorily matches the observations.\nThe total mass for the best fit model is $\\sim4\\times10^{11}M_\\odot$ of which\nabout 50\\% is dark matter. However, models with different total masses and dark\nhalos are also consistent with the data; we estimate that the total mass of\nCen~A within 50~kpc may vary between $3\\times10^{11}M_\\odot$ and\n$5\\times10^{11}M_\\odot$. The best fit model consists of 75\\% of stars rotating\naround the short axis $z$ and 25\\% of stars rotating around the long axis $x$.\nFinally, the morphology of the projected velocity field is analyzed using\nStatler's classification criteria (Statler 1991).

The reaction rates\nfor the above processes are calculated using three--body methods and show an\nenhancement of more than three orders of magnitude compared to the previous\nadopted value. Direct--capture calculations give similar values for the above\nreaction rates. Therefore, this method was also used to calculate the reaction\nrates of the two--step processes $^6$He(2n,$\\gamma$)$^8$He and\n$^9$Li(2n,$\\gamma$)$^{11}$Li and the reverse photodisintegration of $^8$He and\n$^{11}$Li that could be also of importance in the $\\alpha$-process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 1995 19:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The theory is\nthat of two massive scalar particles, `nucleons' and `mesons', interacting via\na Yukawa coupling. We calculate the general Euclidean Green function involving\ntwo external nucleons and an arbitrary number of external mesons in the\nquenched approximation for the nucleons. The non-perturbative renormalization\nand truncation is done in a consistent manner and results in the same\nvariational functional independent of the number of external mesons. We check\nthat the calculation agrees with one-loop perturbation theory for small\ncouplings. As an illustration the special case of meson absorption on the\nnucleon is considered in detail. We derive the radius of the dressed particle\nand numerically investigate the vertex function after analytic continuation to\nMinkowski space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 1995 18:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
