Ever since the\nearly sixties, increasingly larger human and material resources are being\ninvested in the detection effort. Unfortunately, the gravity wave effects one\nhas had to exploit so far are extraordinarily small and are usually very many\norders of magnitude smaller than the noise involved. The detectors that are\npresently at the most advanced stage of development hope to register extremely\nrare, instantaneous longitudinal shifts that are expected to be orders of\nmagnitude smaller than one Fermi. However, it was recently shown that gravity\nwaves can manifest themselves through much larger effects than previously\nenvisaged. One of these new effects is the periodic, apparent shift in a star's\nangular position due to a foreground gravity wave source. The comparative\nlargeness of this effect stems from its being proportional not to the inverse\nof the gravity wave source's distance to the Earth, but to the inverse of its\ndistance to the star's line of sight. In certain optimal but not unrealistic\ncases, the amplitude of this effect can reach the critical bar of one\nmicro-arcsecond, thus raising the prospect that the long awaited first direct\ndetection of gravity waves could be achieved by a high precision astrometry\nspace mission such as GAIA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 1995 21:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
