The full\nspectrum of string excitations is derived as a function of moduli fields\n$T^{i}$ and the scale $\\mu^2=1/(k+2)$ which is induced by the non-zero\nbackground fields. The spectrum of string excitations has a non-zero mass gap\n$\\mu^2$ and in the weak curvature limit ($\\mu$ small) $\\mu^2$ plays the role of\na well defined infrared regulator, consistent with modular invariance, gauge\ninvariance, supersymmetry and chirality.\n  The effects of a covariantly constant (chomo)magnetic field $H$ as well as\nadditional curvature can be derived exactly up to one string-loop level. Thus,\nthe one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational, gauge and Yukawas)\nare unambiguously computed and are finite both in the UltraViolet and the\nInfraRed regime. These corrections are necessary for quantitative string\nsuperunification predictions at low energies. The one-loop corrections to the\ncouplings are also found to satisfy Infrared Flow Equations. Having in our\ndisposal an exact description which goes beyond the leading order in the\n$\\alpha'$-expansion or the linearized approximation in the magnetic field, we\nfind interesting clues about the physics of string theory in strong\ngravitational and magnetic fields. In particular, the nature of gravitational\nor magnetic instabilities is studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 1995 05:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
