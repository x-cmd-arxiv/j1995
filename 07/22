Beginning with\nthe Nielsen identity, we derive a series of identities that govern the gauge\ndependence of these functions. Using these, we show, to leading nontrivial\norder, that even though these functions are individually gauge-dependent, one\nobtains a gauge-independent result for the bubble nucleation rate. Our formal\narguments are complemented by explicit calculations for scalar electrodynamics\nin a class of $R_\\xi$ gauges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 1995 16:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
