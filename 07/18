By\ncontrast, with spin-orbit scattering present, there is no change in the\nlocalization length, and only a small increase in the overall tunneling\namplitude. The numerical data for small magnetic fields $B$, and hopping\nlengths $t$, can be collapsed by using scaling variables $B_\\perp t^{3/2}$, and\n$B_\\parallel t$ in the perpendicular and parallel field orientations\nrespectively. This is in agreement with the flux through a `cigar'--shaped\nregion with a diffusive transverse dimension proportional to $\\sqrt{t}$. If a\nsingle hop dominates the conductivity of the sample, this leads to a\ncharacteristic orientational `finger print' for the MC anisotropy. However, we\nestimate that many hops contribute to conductivity of typical samples, and thus\naveraging over critical hop orientations renders the bulk sample isotropic, as\nseen experimentally. Anisotropy appears for thin films, when the length of the\nhop is comparable to the thickness. The hops are then restricted to align with\nthe sample plane, leading to different MC behaviors parallel and perpendicular\nto it, even after averaging over many hops.
