Here we evaluate the impact\nthat winds may have on the structure of giant nebulae and on their supersonic\nvelocity dispersion. We follow the suggestion from Chu \\& Kennicutt (1994) to\nsee if a combination of a large number of unresolved wind-driven shells caused\nby massive stars could produce the integrated broad Gaussian profiles typical\nof giant HII regions.\n  The results, accounting for a wide range of energies, densities and velocity\nor age of the expanding shells, show that supersonic Gaussian profiles may\narise only from a collection of unresolved wind-driven shells if the shells\npresent a peculiar velocity distribution which implies a strongly peaked age\ndistribution leading to an awkward star formation history. On the other hand, a\nuniform distribution of ages originates profiles with a flat-topped core\ndefined by the terminal shell velocity and a steep decay as $v^{-6}$ up to the\nlargest detectable shell speed. Thus, supersonic profiles can arise only if the\nfinal speed of the unresolved shells is supersonic. This implies an equally\nsupersonic random speed of motions in the ionized gas disrupting the shells\nbefore they slow down to subsonic speeds. It also implies a mechanism,\nindependent of the shells caused by massive stars, responsible for the\nsupersonic stirring of the background medium. These facts together with the\nconditions for shells to remain unresolved to present day devices (energies,\nfinal speeds and ages), indicate that the winds may be produced by low-mass\nstars.
