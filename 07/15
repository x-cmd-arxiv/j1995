Splitting becomes prolific at such field\nstrengths: its principal effect is to degrade photon energies, initiating a\ncascade that softens gamma-ray spectra. Uniform field cascade calculations have\ndemonstrated that emission could be softened to the observed SGR energies for\nfields exceeding about $10^{14}$Gauss. Recently, we have determined splitting\nattenuation lengths and maximum energies for photon escape in neutron star\nenvironments including the effects of magnetospheric dipole field geometry.\nSuch escape energies $\\erg_{esc}$ suitably approximate the peak energy of the\nemergent spectrum, and in this paper we present results for $\\erg_{esc}$ as a\nfunction of photon emission angles for polar cap and equatorial emission\nregions. The escape energy is extremely insensitive to viewing perspective for\nequatorial emission, arguing in favour of such a site for the origin of SGR\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 1995 20:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
