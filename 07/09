On the other hand,\nflat directions among the standard model fields can carry baryon number and\nlead to a possible mechanism for baryogenesis (Affleck Dine baryogenesis). When\nconsidering the cosmological consequences of the flat directions, it is\nimportant to take into account the soft potential with curvature of order the\nHubble constant due to supersymmetry breaking in the early universe.
