IRAS colors of 10 bright isolated sources are studied,\nwhich are presumably representative of the discrete sources in general. The\ncolors follow the well known anticorrelation between the 60micron/100micron\nflux ratio and the 12micron/25micron flux ratio. All sources coincide with\noptical HII regions.

A dust heating/cooling model is developed based on a radiative transfer\nmodel which assumes a `Sandwich' configuration of dust and stars and takes\nfully into account the effect of scattering of dust grains. The model is\napplied to a complete sample of 'cells' (small areas of size $2'\\times 2'$),\ngenerated from the above maps. The sample covers the M31 disk in the\ngalactocentric radius range 2 --- 14 kpc, and includes only the cells for which\nthe contribution of the discrete sources to the 60$\\mu m$ surface brightness is\nnegligible ($< 20$\\%). This effectively excludes most of the bright arm regions\nfrom our analysis. We find that: (1) The mean optical depth (viewed from the\ninclination angle of 77$^\\circ$) increases with radius from $\\tau_V\\sim 0.7$ at\nr=2kpc outwards, reaches a peak of ~1.6 near 10kpc, and stays quite flat out to\n14kpc, where the signal falls below the 5sigma level. (2) A correlation between\n$\\tau_V$ and HI surface density is suggested by the similarity between their\nradial profiles. Significant differences are found between the radial profiles\nof the H_2 gas (estimated from CO) and of the dust (from $\\tau_V$), which are\nmost probably due to the large uncertainty in the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor,\nand to the under-representation of H_2-rich regions in the sample of cells of\ndiffuse regions. (3) The $\\tau_V / N(HI)$ ratio decreases with increasing\nradius in the disk of M31, with an exponential law fit yielding an e-folding\nscale length of $9.6\\pm 0.4$ kpc. (4) The optical depth adjusted for this\ngradient, $\\tau_{V,c}$, is strongly and linearly correlated with N(HI) over one\nand a half order of magnitude of column density, indicating that at a given\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 1995 13:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
