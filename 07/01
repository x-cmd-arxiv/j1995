Physical quantities like momentum distribution and some correlation\nfunctions show some behaviors which are not expected in repulsive models, as\nthe value of $J/t$ increases. These properties as well as energy are well\nunderstood by introducing intersite correlation factors into wave functions.\nThe phase transition to a separated phase in large-$J/t$ region can be\ndescribed by an attractive Jastrow wave function in quantitative agreement with\nthe exact results. On the other hand, for the supersymmetric case ($J/t=2$) the\noriginal Gutzwiller wave function becomes an extremely good trial function for\nall the range of electron density. Here a kind of \\lq\\lq free electron\" state\nis realized, particularly in the low electron density. Next, the above wave\nfunctions are compared with the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid-type wave function\nproposed by Hellberg and Mele.
