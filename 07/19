We point out that the\nbeginning of this cross-over occurs when the gap $\\Delta_g$ becomes comparable\nto the boson energies $\\Omega_{ph}$. This condition is equivalent to the\ncondition of Ref. \\cite{Strinati} $k_F\\xi\\approx 2\\pi$ and traduces the\nphysical constraint that the distance the paired electron covers during the\nabsorbtion of the virtual boson, cannot be larger than the coherence length.\nThe frontier region of couplings is of the order of $\\lambda\\approx 3$, and\nhigh-$T_c$ materials are concerned. A clear qualitative indication of the\noccurence of a cross-over regime should be a dip structure above the gap in the\ndensity of states of excitations. Comparing our results with tunneling and\nphotoemission experiments we conclude that high-$T_c$ materials (cuprates and\nfullerides) are indeed at the beginning of a cross-over from BCS\nsuperconductivity to Bose condensation, even though the fermionic nature still\nprevails.
