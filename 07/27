One major\nconsequence of this theory is that none of the familiar perturbative mechanisms\nmay ruin the classical Kolmogorov (K41) scaling solution for the structure\nfunctions. Accordingly, corrections to the K41 solutions should be sought in\nnonperturbative effects.

When the\nHiggs scalar field belongs to the 210-dimensional irreducible representation of\nSO(10), attention is focused on the mass matrix relevant for the\nSU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) symmetry-breaking direction, to agree with low-energy\nphenomenology of the particle-physics standard model. The analysis is\nrestricted to those values of the tree-level-potential parameters for which the\nabsolute minima of the classical potential have been evaluated. As shown in the\nrecent literature, such minima turn out to be SO(6)xSO(4)- or\nSU(3)xSU(2)xSU(2)xU(1)-invariant. Electroweak phenomenology is more naturally\nderived, however, from the former minima. Hence the values of the parameters\nleading to the alternative set of minima have been discarded. Within this\nframework, flat-space limit and general form of the one-loop effective\npotential are studied in detail by using analytic and numerical methods. It\nturns out that, as far as the absolute-minimum direction is concerned, the\nflat-space limit of the one-loop calculation about a de Sitter background does\nnot change the results previously obtained in the literature, where the\ntree-level potential in flat space-time was studied. Moreover, when curvature\neffects are no longer negligible in the one-loop potential, it is found that\nthe early universe remains bound to reach only the SO(6)xSO(4) absolute\nminimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 1995 12:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Two kinds of these biharmonic\nfield theories are distinguished, characterized by the possibility or not of\nthe scalar fields to transform non-trivially under Weyl transformations. Both\ncases are relevant for string theory and two dimensional gravity. The\nbiharmonic conformal field theories provide higher order corrections to the\nequations of motion of the metric and give a possibility of adding new terms to\nthe Polyakov action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 1995 17:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Then we see that the deformation space of the subfamily\nis the same as a certain family of K3 toric surfaces.
