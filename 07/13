Then, we classify the galaxy by comparing the\nrelative strengths of the components with those of galaxies of known\nmorphological type. In particular, we use the ratios of (1) the emission line\nto absorption line contribution, (2) the young to old stellar contribution, and\n(3) the oxygen to hydrogen emission line contribution. We calibrate and test\nthe method using published morphological types for 32 galaxies from the\nlong-slit spectroscopic survey of Kennicutt (1992) and for 304 galaxies from a\nfiber spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxy clusters. From an analysis of a\nsample of long-slit spectra of spiral galaxies in two galaxy clusters, we\nconclude that the majority of the galaxies observed in the fiber survey are\nsufficiently distant that their spectral classification is unaffected by\naperture bias.

Then there appear three\nfundamental scattering processes;a) scattering between parallel spins,b)\nscattering between antiparallel spins and c) scattering with spin-flip. To\nexamine how these scattering processes affect the dynamical spin fluctuations,\nwe pick up carefully all possible combination of RPA diagrams in a consistent\nmanner and take the spin rotational symmetry into account. Then it becomes\nclear that we have to take up a sequence of the irreducible single loop which\nin itself is modified due to the particle-hole ladder type vertex correction.We\nset up the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the vertex correction and show that this\ncan be solved in a closed form due to separable nature of the antiferromagnetic\ninteraction.

The more\nrecently formulated variable-flavor scheme includes, in addition, the flavor\nexcitation process where the initial state partons of all flavors contribute\nabove their respective threshold, as commonly accepted for calculations of\nother high energy processes; this was initially carried out to leading\norder--\\alphas^1. We first compare and contrast these existing calculations. As\nexpected from physical grounds, the next-to-leading-order fixed-flavor scheme\ncalculation yields good results near threshold, while the leading-order\nvariable-flavor scheme calculation works well for asymptotic Q^2. The quality\nof the calculations in the intermediate region is dependent upon the x and Q^2\nvalues chosen. An accurate self-consistent QCD calculation over the entire\nrange can be obtained by extending the variable-flavor scheme to\nnext-to-leading-order. Recent work to carry out this calculation is described.\nPreliminary numerical results of this calculation are also presented for\ncomparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 1995 01:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Rev. A, {\\bf 45}, 43 (1992)) can be derived by the adiabatic\napproximation. In fact, it is shown that greatest is the perturbation and more\nsimilar the quantum system is to an adiabatic one, the solution being written\nas a superposition of eigenstates of the time-dependent perturbation.A direct\nconsequence of this result is that the solution of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nin the interaction picture, in the same approximation for the perturbation,\ncoincides with the one of the leading order of the strong field approximation.\nThe limitation due to the requirement that the perturbation has to commute at\ndifferent times is so overcome. Computational difficulties could arise to go to\nhigher orders. Beside, the method is not useful for perturbations that are\nconstant in time. In such a case a small time series is obtained, indicating\nthat this approximation is just an application to quantum mechanics of the\nKirkwood-Wigner expansion of statistical mechanics. The theory obtained in this\nway is applied to a time-dependent two-level spin model, already considered for\nthe study of the Berry's phase, showing that a geometrical phase could arise if\na part of the hamiltonian is considered as a strong perturbation. No adiabatic\napproximation is taken on the parameters of the hamiltonian, while their\ncyclicity is retained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 1995 23:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
