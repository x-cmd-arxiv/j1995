The non-crossing approximation is the simplest\nconserving approximation and has led to useful insights into strongly\ncorrelated models of magnetic impurities. At low energies and temperatures the\nmethod is known to be inaccurate for dynamical properties due to the appearance\nof singularities in the physical Green's functions. The problems in developing\nalternative reliable theories for dynamical properties have made it difficult\nto quantify these inaccuracies. As a first step in obtaining a theory which is\nvalid also in the low energy regime, we identify the origin of the problems\nwithin the NCA. We show, by comparison with close to exact NRG calculations for\nthe auxiliary and physical particle spectral functions, that the main source of\nerror in the NCA is in the lack of vertex corrections in the convolution\nformulae for physical Green's functions. We show that the dynamics of the\nauxiliary particles within NCA is essentially correct for a large parameter\nregion, including the physically interesting Kondo regime, for all energy\nscales down to $T_{0}$, the low energy scale of the model, and often well below\nthis scale. Despite the satisfactory description of the auxiliary particle\ndynamics, the physical spectral functions are not obtained accurately on scales\n$\\sim T_{0}$.

In\nthis case the corrections to two-dimensional behavior due to the presence of\nthe other layers are very small. Next, renormalization group equations for a\nlayered system with very strong Josephson coupling are derived, taking into\naccount only the smallest possible Josephson vortex loops. The applicability of\nthese two limiting cases to typical high-temperature superconductors is\ndiscussed. Finally, it is argued that the original renormalization group\napproach by Kosterlitz is not applicable to a layered system with intermediate\nJosephson coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 1995 16:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
