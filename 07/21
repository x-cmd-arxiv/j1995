The tri-variate luminosity\nfunction phi(M,color,z) shows unambiguously that the population evolves and\nthat this evolution is strongly differential with color and, less strongly,\nwith luminosity. The luminosity function of red galaxies shows very little\nchange in either number density or luminosity over the entire redshift range 0\n< z < 1. In contrast, the luminosity function of blue galaxies shows\nsubstantial evolution at redshifts z > 0.5. By 0.5 < z < 0.75, the blue\nluminosity function appears to have uniformly brightened by approximately 1\nmag. At higher redshifts, the evolution appears to saturate at the brightest\nmagnitudes but continues at fainter levels leading to a steepening of the\nluminosity function. A significant excess of galaxies relative to the Loveday\net al. (1992) local luminosity function is seen at low redshifts z < 0.2 around\nM(B) ~ -18$ and these galaxies may possibly represent the descendants of the\nevolving blue population seen at higher redshifts. The changes seen in the\nluminosity function are also apparent in color-magnitude diagrams constructed\nat different epochs and in the V/V_max statistic computed as a function of\nspectral type. Finally, it is argued that the picture of galaxy evolution\npresented here is consistent with the very much smaller samples of field\ngalaxies that have been selected in other wavebands, and with the results of\nstudies of galaxies selected on the basis of Mg II 2799 absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 1995 21:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

These sorts of similarity would be expected to convey advantages\non language learners in the form of transfer from one morphological category to\nanother. Connectionist models of morphology acquisition have been faulted for\ntheir supposed inability to represent phonological similarity across\nmorphological categories and hence to facilitate transfer. This paper describes\na connectionist model of the acquisition of morphology which is shown to\nexhibit transfer of this type. The model treats the morphology acquisition\nproblem as one of learning to map forms onto meanings and vice versa. As the\nnetwork learns these mappings, it makes phonological generalizations which are\nembedded in connection weights. Since these weights are shared by different\nmorphological categories, transfer is enabled.

The approach provides the means\nto follow the quantum dynamics in both space-time and energy-momentum, starting\nfrom an arbitrary initial configuration of high-momentum quarks and gluons.\nUsing a generalized functional integral representation and adopting the\n`closed-time-path' Green function techniques, a self-consistent set of\nequations of motions is obtained: a Ginzburg-Landau equation for a possible\ncolor background field, and Dyson-Schwinger equations for the 2-point functions\nof the gluon and quark fields. By exploiting the `two-scale nature' of\nlight-cone dominated QCD processes, i.e. the separation between the quantum\nscale that specifies the range of short-distance quantum fluctuations, and the\nkinetic scale that characterizes the range of statistical binary inter-\nactions, the quantum-field equations of motion are converted into a correspon-\nding set of `renormalization equations' and `transport equations'. The former\ndescribe renormalization and dissipation effects through the evolution of the\nspectral density of individual, dressed partons, whereas the latter determine\nthe statistical occurrence of scattering processes among these dressed partons.\nThe renormalization equations and the transport equations are coupled, and\nhence must be solved self-consistently. This amounts to evolving the\nmulti-parton system, from a specified initial configuration, in time and full\n7-dimensional phase-space. This description provides a proba- bilistic\ninterpretation and is therefore of important practical value for the solution\nof the dynamical equations of motion, e.g. by Monte Carlo simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 1995 07:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
