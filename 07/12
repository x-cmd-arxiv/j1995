This was seen to be a counterexample to the standard\n'sigma model' scenario which predicts the 2D Ising model universality class. In\nthis article we present more evidence, both theoretical and numerical, that\nthis result is correct. We develop a physical picture for our results and\ndiscuss the width of the scaling region (Ginzburg criterion), $1/N$\ncorrections, and differences between the dynamics of BCS superconductors and\nGross-Neveu models. Lattices as large as $12 \\times 72^2$ are simulated for\nboth the $N=12$ and $N=4$ cases and the numerical evidence for mean field\nscaling is quite compelling. We point out that the amplitude ratio for the\nmodel's susceptibility is a particulartly good observable for distinguishing\nbetween the dimensional reduction and the mean field scenerios, because this\nuniversal quantity differs by almost a factor of $20$ in the two cases. The\nsimulations are done close to the critical point in both the symmetric and\nbroken phases, and correlation lengths of order $10$ are measured. The critical\nindices $\\beta_{mag}$ and $\\delta$ also pick out mean field behavior. We trace\nthe breakdown of the standard scenario (dimensional reduction and universality)\nto the composite character of the mesons in the model. We point out that our\nresults should be generic for theories with dynamical symmetry breaking, such\nas Quantum Chromodynamics.\n  We also simulated the $O(2)$ model on $8 \\times 16^3$ lattices to establish\nthat our methods give the results of dimensional reduction in purely bosonic\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 1995 16:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 1995 15:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

This definite trajectory gives BM a somewhat\nmore classical flavor than most other forms of quantum mechanics (QM) (though\nthe trajectory certainly has highly nonlocal and other nonclassical aspects in\nits evolution), but to see whether or not this makes a difference for\nobservations by conscious beings, one needs to attach theories of conscious\nperceptions to BM and other forms of QM. Here I shall propose various forms of\ntheories of consciousness for BM, which I shall call {\\it Sensible Bohmian\nMechanics} (SBM), and compare them with a proposal I have made for a theory of\nconsciousness attached to bare QM, which I call {\\it Sensible Quantum\nMechanics} (SQM) [11-15]. I find that only certain special forms of SBM would\ngive essentially similar predictions as SQM, though a wider class might be in\npractice indistinguishable to any single observer. I also remain sceptical that\na viable complete form of SBM will turn out to be as simple a description of\nthe universe as a viable complete form of SQM, but of course it is too early to\nknow yet what the form of the simplest complete theory of our universe is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 1995 23:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
