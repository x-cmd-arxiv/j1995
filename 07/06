The analytic calculation is based on the simple\nsecondary infall model where spherical symmetry is assumed.

The main purpose of using such code is to suppress\noff-center mergers. In all cases studied here the rotation curves calculated by\nthe two numerical codes are in agreement over most of the mass of the halos,\nexcluding the very inner region, and these are compared with the analytically\ncalculated ones.

For a system of\nnon-interacting anyons in a harmonic potential, each trajectory consists of two\ninfinite straight line segments, in general connected by a nonlinear piece. We\ngive the systematics of the three-anyon trajectories. The trajectories in\ngeneral cross each other at the bosonic/fermionic points. We use the\n(semi-empirical) rule that all such crossings are true crossings, i.e.\\ the\norder of the trajectories with respect to energy is opposite to the left and to\nthe right of a crossing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 1995 14:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

A state\nthat starts as a Minkowski vacuum at past null infinity gets entangled with the\ngravity sector, so that close to the horizon it can be represented by a\nstatistical ensemble of orthogonal states. We construct an operator connecting\nthe different states and comment on the possible physical meaning of the above\nconstruction. The induced energy-momentum tensor of these states is computed in\nthe neighbourhood of the horizon, and it is found that energy-momentum\nfluctuations become large in the region where the bulk of the Hawking radiation\nis produced. The background spacetime as seen by an outside observer may be\ndrastically altered in this region, and an outside observer should see\nsignificant interactions between the infalling matter and the outgoing Hawking\nradiation. The boundary of the region of strong quantum gravitational effects\nis given by a time-like hypersurface of constant Schwarzschild radius $r$ one\nPlanck unit away from the horizon. This boundary hypersurface is an example of\na stretched horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 1995 13:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 1995 05:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We\nverify the conjecture for $r=1$, and more generally for Drinfeld modules having\npotential good reduction at some prime above a specified prime of $K$.\nMoreover, we show that within an $\\Lbar$-isomorphism class, there are only\nfinitely many Drinfeld modules up to isomorphism over $L$ which have nonzero\ntorsion. For the case $A=\\Fq[T]$, $r=1$, and $L=\\Fq(T)$, we give an explicit\ndescription of the possible torsion submodules. We present three methods for\nproving these cases of the conjecture, and explain why they fail to prove the\nconjecture in general. Finally, an application of the Mordell conjecture for\ncharacteristic $p$ function fields proves the uniform boundedness for the\n$\\pp$-primary part of the torsion for rank~2 Drinfeld $\\Fq[T]$-modules over a\nfixed function field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
