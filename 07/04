The analysis concentrates on calculating radiative\ncorrections to tree-level mass relations for third generation fermions. The\ntree-level relation $m_b/m_{\\tau}=1$ predicted by such models can receive large\nradiative corrections up to about $50\\%$ due to threshold effects at the mass\nunification scale. These corrections are thus of about the same importance as\nthose that give rise to renormalisation group running. The high figure of\n$50\\%$ can be achieved because 1-loop graphs involving the physical charged\nHiggs boson give corrections to $m_{\\tau}-m_b$ that are proportional to the\nlarge top quark mass. These corrections can either increase or decrease\n$m_b/m_{\\tau}$ depending on the value of an unknown parameter. They can also be\nmade to vanish through a fine-tuning. A related model of tree-level\n$t$-$b$-$\\tau$ unification which uses the identification of SU(2)$_R$ with\ncustodial SU(2) is then discussed. A curious relation $m_b \\simeq \\sqrt{2}\nm_{\\tau}$ is found to be satisfied at tree-level in this model. The overall\nconclusion of this work is that the tree-level relation $m_b = m_{\\tau}$ at low\nscales such as 1000 TeV or somewhat higher can produce a successful value for\n$m_b/m_{\\tau}$ after corrections, but one must be mindful that radiative\ncorrections beyond those incorporated through the renormalisation group can be\nvery important.

In\nthis way, we recover the standard vacuum of QCD with $N_f$ flavors and $N_c$\ncolors when $N_f < N_c$. However, for $N_f \\geq N_c$, we find new exotic\nstates---new vacua with spontaneously broken baryon number for $N_f = N_c$, and\na vacuum state with unbroken chiral symmetry for $N_f > N_c$. These exotic\nvacua contain massless composite fermions and, in some cases, dynamically\ngenerated gauge bosons. In particular Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality seems\nto persist also in the presence of (small) soft supersymmetry breaking. We\nargue that certain, specially tailored, lattice simulations may be able to\ndetect the novel phenomena.
