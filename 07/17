The main purpose of the present paper\nis to make clear that classical dynamics of a totally constrained system is\nnothing but the foliation of the constraint submanifold in phase space by the\ninvolutive system of infinitesimal canonical transformations $Y_\\alpha$\ngenerated by the constraint functions. From this point of view it is shown that\nstatistical dynamics for an ensemble of a totally constrained system can be\nformulated in terms of a relative distribution function without gauge fixing or\nreduction. There the key role is played by the fact that the canonical measure\nin phase space and the vector fields $Y_\\alpha$ induce natural conservative\nmeasures on acausal submanifolds, which are submanifolds transversal to the\ndynamical foliation. Further it is shown that the structure coefficients\n$c^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta}$ defined by $\\{h_\\alpha,h_\\beta\\}=\\sum_\\gamma\nc^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta}h_\\gamma$ should weakly commute with $h_\\alpha$,\n$\\sum_\\gamma\\{h_\\gamma,c^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta}\\}\\approx0$, in order that the\ndescription in terms of the relative distribution function is consistent.

This leads to a foliation of\nthe state space by linear manifolds on each of which $\\Psi$ is constant, and\ndynamics is described as linear mappings among acausal subspaces which are\ntransversal to these linear manifolds.

We compute the couplings in the context\nof a nonrelativistic quark model. The difference between the up and down\nconstituent masses induces a coupling of the neutral pion to the proton that is\nslightly larger than the corresponding one for the neutron. This difference\ngenerates a large isospin-violating correction---proportional to the\nisospin-even contribution arising from the nucleon Born terms---to the\ncharge-exchange ($\\pi^{-}p \\rightarrow \\pi^{0}n$) amplitude. In contrast to the\nisospin-conserving case, this correction is not cancelled by $\\sigma$-meson\nexchange; in our model there is no isospin-violating $NN\\sigma$ coupling at\n$q^2=0$. As a result, we find a violation of the triangle identity consistent\nwith the one reported by Gibbs, Ai, and Kaufmann from a recent analysis of\npion-nucleon data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 1995 15:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

An interesting\ncorrelation between the order of initial commutation relations and the Cartan\nmatrix of the resulting algebra is observed. Another example demonstrates that\nthe bialgebra structure of sl_q(2) can be completely determined by requiring\nthe q-oscillator algebra to be its covariant comodule, in analogy with Manin's\napproach to define SL_q(2) as a symmetry algebra of the bosonic and fermionic\nquantum planes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 1995 14:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
