Four different techniques are utilized: the\ncluster-cluster correlation function, axial ratios and quadrupoles of the dark\nmatter distribution in individual clusters, and virial properties. We find that\nthe correlation function for clusters of the same mass limit was larger and\nsteeper at high redshifts. The slope increases from 1.8 at z=0 to 2.1 at z=0.5.\nComoving correlation length r_c scales with the mass limit M within comoving\nradius 1.5 h^-1 Mpc and the redshift z as r_c ~= 20(1+z)(M/M_*)^1/3, where M_*\n= 3*10^14 h^-1 M_sun. When the correlation length is normalized to the mean\ncluster separation d_c, it remains almost constant: r_c~=(0.45-0.5) d_c. For\nsmall masses (M_clust <2*10^14 h^-1 M_sun) there is an indication that r_c goes\nslightly above the relation with the constant of proportionality being ~=\n0.55-0.6. Anisotropy of density distribution in a cluster shows no change over\nredshift with axial ratios remaining constant around 1.2. In other words,\nclusters at present are as elongated as they were at the epoch of their first\nappearance. While the anisotropy of clusters does not change with time, the\ndensity profile shows visible evolution: the slope of density profile changes\nfrom gamma ~= -3.5 at z=0.5 to gamma ~= -2.5 at the present. We find that the\ncore of a cluster remains essentially the same over time, but the density of\nthe outlying regions increases noticeably. The virial relation M ~ v^2 is a\ngood approximation, but there is a large fraction of clusters with peculiar\nvelocities greater than given by this relation, and clusters with the same rms\nvelocities have smaller masses in the past, a factor of 2 at z=0.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 1995 18:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
