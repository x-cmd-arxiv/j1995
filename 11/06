The well known intensity\nchange due to microlensing is found to be less important. For typical stellar\nmasses, the flux magnification can be significant only if the lens passes very\nclose to the pulsar--Earth axis. We show that in the case of a pulsar the time\nvarying travel-time delay, which is observable because of the pulsating nature\nof pulsar radiation, is a much more powerful tool to investigate mass\ndistributions in the GC. We find that a travel-time delay is measurable even\nfor rather large distances between the lens and the pulsar--Earth axis.\n  The time varying travel-time delay can be used to determine the mass of the\nlens and the ratio of the transverse velocity to the minimum impact parameter.\nBased on Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic data sets we give the expected\naccuracies in the parameter determination for various masses.\n  We argue that pulsars found behind the very center of our Galaxy would\nprovide an excellent opportunity to test the mass distribution in the Galactic\nnucleus, and therefore to distinguish between a super massive black hole (SMBH)\nand a super-dense star cluster (SDSC) within the central 0.1 pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 1995 17:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In the second\npart electromagnetic nucleon form factors (FFs) with relativistic corrections\nare evaluated in a chiral soliton model including vector mesons. The magnetic\nFF $G_M^p$ is shown to agree well with new SLAC data for spacelike $Q^2$ up to\n30(GeV/c)$^2$ if superconvergence is enforced.
