For models with purely\nferromagnetic interactions in one dimension, we show that for strong randomness\nthere is a second order transition with critical properties that can be\ndetermined exactly by use of an RG procedure. Somewhat surprisingly, the\ncritical behaviour is completely independent of $q$ (for $2 \\leq q < \\infty$).\nFor the $q > 4$ clock model, we suggest the existence of a novel multicritical\npoint at intermediate randomness. We also consider the $T = 0$ transition from\na paramagnet to a spin glass in an infinite range model. Assuming that the\ntransition is second order, we solve for the critical behaviour and find $q$\nindependent exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 1995 17:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
