We\nuse both $1/N_c$ and chiral counting to organize the calculation. Then we\ncalculate the leading and next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion low\nenergy contributions using the Extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as hadronic\nmodel. We do that to all orders in the external momenta and quark masses\nexpansion. Although the hadronic light-by-light contributions to muon $g-2$ are\nnot saturated by these low energy contributions we estimate them\nconservatively. A detailed analysis of the different hadronic light-by-light\ncontributions to muon $g-2$ is done. The dominant contribution is the twice\nanomalous pseudoscalar exchange diagram. The final result we get is $a_\\mu^{\\rm\nlight-by-light}= (-9.2\\pm3.2 ) \\cdot 10^{-10}$. This is between two and three\ntimes the expected experimental uncertainty at the forthcoming BNL muon $g-2$\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 1995 09:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 1996 12:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
