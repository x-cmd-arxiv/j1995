Low-mass stars (with $M=0.2\nM_{TO}$ or $0.5 M_{TO}$) are assumed to be fully convective and are therefore\nmodeled as $n=1.5$ polytropes.

We show that\nthere exist static BPS configurations which remain in equilibrium even if they\nconsist of states with opposite electric (or magnetic) charges from vector\nmultiplets. This is possible because of the exact cancellation between the\nCoulomb and scalar forces. In particular, in the theories with N=4 or N=2\nsupersymmetry there exist stable massless multi center configurations with\nvanishing total charge. Since such configurations have vanishing energy and\ncharge independently of their number, they can be associated with flat\ndirections in the space of all possible BPS states.
