I describe the `first' and `second'\nparameter effects on HB morphology, and attempt to summarize the current state\nof affairs and how future investigations might improve our findings in this\narea. I also briefly discuss the topic that has generated the most theoretical\nattention over the last 5 years, that of the hot end of HB sequences. I then\ndiscuss the current state of HB theory, reviewing the effect of new physics on\nthe models, and the special considerations (partial mixing) that arise in core\nhelium burning models. Finally, I discuss two other outstanding issues. After\nnoting that the mass loss mechanism is not at all understood, I review detailed\nwork by several different groups concerning the age, abundance spread, and\nrotational properties of RGB and HB stars in the `second parameter' clusters M3\nand M13. I conclude by discussing the HB luminosity-metallicity relation. The\ndiscrepancy between the slope of this relation from different lines of argument\nappears largely to have been resolved. However, the observational data and\ntheoretical sequences (if Y ~ 0.23) are still in conflict as far as the HB\nluminosity zero-point is concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 1995 18:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This means that the output of an interferometer must be\ncross- correlated with many waveform templates to dig out faint signals buried\nin the noise. The templates are characterized by several parameters which vary\ncontinuously over some finite range; but because the amount of computing power\navailable to perform the cross-correlations of the search templates with the\noutput is finite, the actual templates used must be picked with certain\ndiscrete values of these parameters, which will have some finite spacing. If\nthe spacing is too small, the number of templates (and therefore the computing\npower) needed to perform an on-line search becomes prohibitive; if the spacing\nis too large, many chirps will not be detected because the values of their\nparameters lie too far from those of the nearest template. In this paper I use\ndifferential geometry to extend the earlier formalism of Sathyaprakash and\nDhurandhar to estimate the template spacing, number of templates, and computing\npower required for a single-pass, on-line search of the output of a single\ninterferometer in terms of the fraction of events lost to parameter\ndiscretization. My formalism obtains these results with little numerical\ncomputation, and is valid for arbitrary noise spectra and template\nparameterizations.
