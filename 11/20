Our reexamination of silicon burning, using\nresults gleaned from simulation work done with a large nuclear network (299\nnuclei and more than 3000 reactions) and from independent calculations of\nequilibrium abundance distributions, offers new insights into the\nquasi-equilibrium mechanism and the approach to nuclear statistical\nequilibrium. We find that the degree to which the matter has been neutronized\nis of great importance, not only to the final products but also to the rate of\nenergy generation and the membership of the quasi-equilibrium groups. A small\nincrease in the global neutronization results in much larger free neutron\nfluences, increasing the abundances of more neutron-rich nuclei. As a result,\nincomplete silicon burning results in neutron richness among the isotopes of\nthe iron peak much larger than the global neutronization would indicate.\nFinally, we briefly discuss the limitations and pitfalls of models for silicon\nburning currently employed within hydrodynamic models. In a forthcoming paper\nwe will present a new approximation to the full nuclear network which preserves\nthe most important features of the large nuclear network calculations at a\nsignificant improvement in computational speed.

This requirement of the degeneracy of\ndifferent phases is a special case of what we call the multiple point\ncriticality principle. In the present work we use the Standard Model all the\nway to the Planck scale, and do not introduce supersymmetry or any extension of\nthe Standard Model gauge group. A possible model to explain the multiple point\ncriticality principle is lack of locality fundamentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 1995 12:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Although it breaks the local gauge symmetry only\nin the regulator fields' sector, its trace disappears completely after removing\nthe regularization as a result of superrenormalizability of the model.

The source of ambiguities in the covariant gauges\nis studied in detail.
