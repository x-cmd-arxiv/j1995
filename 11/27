With the standard algorithm, the noise leading to\nrelaxation can be reduced by making the expansion basis similar to the particle\ndistribution and by carefully choosing the maximum order in the expansion. The\nproposed algorithm accomplishes both tasks simultaneously while the simulation\nis running. This procedure is asymptotically equivalent to expanding in an\northogonal series which is matched to the distribution to start and truncating\nat low order. Because the modified algorithm adapts to a time-evolving\ndistribution, it has advantage over a fixed basis.\n  The required changes to the standard algorithm are minor and do not affect\nits overall structure or scalability. Tests show that the overhead in CPU time\nis small in practical applications. The decrease in relaxation rate is\ndemonstrated for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric systems and the\nrobustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by following the evolution of\nunstable generalized polytropes.
