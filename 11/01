Tutorial instruction is a\nflexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an\ninstructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in\nwhatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the\nagent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of\ninstructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves\nsuch learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It\ncombines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each\ninstruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete\nexplanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar\nthat learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from\ninteractive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key\nrequirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous\nsystems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point;\n(2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to\na hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance,\nconditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class\nof knowledge it uses to perform tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

When spacetime is curved and/or\nhas boundaries, we argue that the bound should hold in regions small compared\nto the minimum local characteristic radius of curvature or the distance to any\nboundaries, since spacetime can be considered approximately Minkowski on these\nscales. We apply the bound to the stress-energy of static traversable wormhole\nspacetimes.

A pronounced dependence of\nthe potential energy on ``cartwheel'' rotations of the molecular axis is found.\nThe calculated PES shows no indication of the presence of a precursor state in\nfront of the surface. Both results indicate that steering effects determine the\nobserved decrease of the sticking coefficient at low energies of the H_2\nmolecules. We show that the topology of the PES is related to the dependence of\nthe covalent H(s)-Pd(d) interactions on the orientation of the H_2 molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 1995 15:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 1995 07:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The\nuncertainties arising from less than precise knowledge of the condensate values\nand other input parameters are analyzed via a Monte-Carlo error analysis.

We first clarify that\nthere coexist mutually opposite two statistics in the AMD framework: One is the\nclassical statistics of the motion of wave packet centroids and the other is\nthe quantum statistics of the motion of wave packets which is described by the\nAMD wave function. We prove the classical statistics of wave packet centroids\nby using the framework of the microcanonical ensemble of the nuclear system. We\nshow that the quantum statistics of wave packets emerges from the classical\nstatistics of wave packet centroids. It is emphasized that the temperature of\nthe classical statistics of wave packet centroids is different from the\ntemperature of the quantum statistics of wave packets. We then explain that the\nstatistical properties of AMD for nucleon emission processes are classical\nbecause nucleon emission processes in AMD are described by the motion of wave\npacket centroids. When we improve the description of the nucleon emission\nprocess so as to take into account the momentum fluctuation due to the wave\npacket spread, the AMD statistical properties for nucleon emission processes\nchange drastically into quantum statistics. Our study of nucleon emission\nprocesses can be conversely regarded as giving another kind of proof of the\nfact that the statistics of wave packets is quantum mechanical while that of\nwave packet centroids is classical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 1995 07:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
