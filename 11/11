Even though this behavior would clearly have far reaching\nimplications for cosmology such theories have not been fully investigated in\nthe literature. This is at least partially due to the counter intuitive nature\nof the result, which has led to speculations that it is merely an artifact of\nperturbation theory. To address this issue we study the simplest model\ndisplaying high temperature symmetry breaking using a Wilson renormalization\ngroup approach. We find that although the critical temperature is not reliably\nestimated by the loop expansion the total volume of parameter space which leads\nto the inverse phase structure is not significantly different from the\nperturbative prediction. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the\ncoupling constants and find that they run approximately according to their\none-loop $\\beta$-functions at high temperature. Thus, in particular, the\nquartic coupling of $phi^4$ theory is shown to increase with temperature, in\ncontrast to the behavior obtained in some previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 1995 22:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 1996 00:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 1997 19:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
