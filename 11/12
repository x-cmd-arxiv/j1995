The sample is studied for proximity effect. We have tried to account\nfor the effect of blending which is inherent in the intermediate resolution\nsample, by calculating the column density distribution, using an effective\nvelocity dispersion parameter, from the observed equivalent width distribution.\nThe use of this column density distribution in the proximity effect analysis\nreduces the background intensity values by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to the\nvalues obtained by using the column density distribution obtained from high\nresolution observations. Evidence is presented for a weak correlation between\nthe effective velocity dispersion parameter and equivalent width. Such a\ncorrelation if present can increase the background values by a factor of up to\n1.5. Considerations of proximity in the spectra of 16 QSOs, from our sample,\nexhibiting damped Ly ${\\alpha}$ lines gives a background intensity which is 3\ntimes smaller than the values obtained from the whole sample, confirming the\npresence of dust in the damped Ly $\\alpha$ systems. Lines close to the QSOs are\nshown to be marginally stronger and broader compared to lines away from the\nQSOs. The Ly $\\alpha$ lines with absorption redshift larger than emission\nredshift are shown to be uncorrelated with QSO luminosity, radio loudness or\noptical spectral index. These lines occur more frequently at high redshifts.\nTheir presence is correlated weakly with the presence of associated metal line\nsystems. The possibilities that the QSO emission redshift is considerably\nhigher and that either the Ly $\\alpha$ clouds or the QSOs have peculiar\nvelocities are considered.

In particular, we study the thermodynamics of a string network\nwithin a toroidal universe, as a function of string energy density and space\ndimensionality. We find that when the energy density of the system is low, the\ndominant part of the string is in the form of closed loops of the shortest\nallowed size, which correspond to the momentum string modes. At a certain\ncritical energy density corresponding to the Hagedorn temperature, the system\nundergoes a phase transition characterized by the formation of very long loops,\nwinding a number of times around the torus. These loops correspond to the\nwinding string modes. As the energy density is increased, all the extra energy\ngoes into these long strings. We then study the lifetime of winding modes as a\nfunction of the space densionality. We find that in the low--energy density\nregime, long winding strings decay only if the space dimensionality of the\ntoroidal universe is equal to 3. This finding supports the proposed\ncosmological scenario by Brandenberger and Vafa, which attempts to explain the\nspace dimensionality and to avoid the initial singularity by means of string\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 1995 15:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
