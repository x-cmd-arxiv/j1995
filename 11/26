The\nobserved angular distribution is isotropic, while the brightness distribution\nof bursts shows a reduced number of faint events. These observations favor a\ncosmological burst origin. Alternatively, very extended Galactic Halo (EGH)\nmodels have been considered. In the latter scenario, the currently favored\nsource of gamma-ray bursts involves high velocity pulsars ejected from the\nGalactic disk. To be compatible with the observed isotropy, most models invoke\na sampling distance of 300 kpc, a turn-on delay of 30 Myrs, and a source life\ntime of about 1 Gyr. We consider the global energy requirements of such models\nand show that the largest known resource. rotational kinetic energy, is\ninsufficient by orders of magnitude to provide the observed burst rate. More\nexotic energy sources or differently tuned pulsar models may be able to get\naround the global energy constraint but at the cost of becoming contrived.\nThus, while extended halo models are not ruled out, our arguments place a\nsevere obstacle for such models and we encourage proponents of EGH models to\nclearly address the issue of global energetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 1995 18:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
