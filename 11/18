Properties\nof Mg II absorbers with W(Fe II)/W(MgII) (definded as R) >and< 0.5 are analysed\nseparately. Contrary to the whole Mg II sample, the clouds with R<0.5 show a\nsteep increase in number density (N(z)) with z. These systems also show clear\nincrease in W(Mg II) and doublet ratio(dr) of Mg II with z. However there is no\ncorrelation between W(Mg II) and dr. In the case of R>0.5 clouds W(Mg II) and\ndr are not correlated with z. However there is a clear anticorrelation between\ndr and W(Mg II). We find a clear decrease in the ratio of W(Fe II) and W(Mg II)\nwith z. The N(z) as well as average N(Fe II) of Fe II lines selected absorbers\nare not evolving with z. The available data of LLS, are not showing any\ndependence of (tau_{LLS}) on z. We collected the LLS information for 53 QSO\nsight lines, for which details of Mg II absorption are available. There are 4\nMg II absorption systems which are not LLS at z which are lower than the mean z\nof the sample (z=1.1). In the higher z, where one expect to see 2.5\\pm1.4 such\nabsorbers, we do not find any nonLLS Mg II absorbers. Individual systems with\ntau_{LLS}<3.0 are analysed. Our results imply some of the absorbers at z=0.6\nhave reached metallicity roughly around solar value. The required ionization\nparameters for these systems are less than 0.001 in most cases. Our results\ntogether with results obtained for high z absorbers confirm that mean\nionization state of metal rich absorbing clouds falls with z.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 1995 00:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
