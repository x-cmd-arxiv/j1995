In contrast to previous considerations we show\nthat the initial density fold should be quasi-one-dimensional (bar-like)\ninstead of disc-like. The disc component of the galaxies appears only during\nthe evolution. The model naturally reproduces some essential features of the\ngalaxies. In particular, it reproduces all the observed typical forms of the\nrotation curves for the spiral galaxies with a characteristic minimum and\nplateau. It appears that the plateau corresponds to escaping the matter\n(external spiral arms, due to initial conditions, have too large velocities to\nbe confined by the gravitational field of the galaxy). Such a scenario of the\ngalaxy evolution leads to the conclusion that the hypothesis of the dark matter\nis not necessary (at least, for the spiral galaxies).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 1995 19:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that this is a very model-dependent statement and the colour\ntriplet can be as light as the weak doublet without leading to the proton decay\nproblem: instead of using the mass difference the splitting can occur between\nthe doublet and triplet Yukawa coupling constants. In this scenario the GUT\nsymmetry breaking automatically induces an extremely strong suppression $\\sim\nM_W/M_{GUT}$ of the coloured Higgs effective Yukawa coupling; this happens\nwithout any fine--tuning, just because of the Clebsch factors. Conceptual\ndifferences of the above picture are: (1) an essentially stable proton: both $d\n= 5$ and $d = 6$ proton decay mediating operators are suppressed by the same\nfactors $\\sim (M_w/M_{GUT})^2$; (2) the possibility of solving the $\\mu$\nproblem by the light gauge singlet field (this fact would lead to the\ndestabilization of the hierarchy in the standard case); (3) the existence of\nthe long--lived, light, coloured and charged supermultiplet in the 100 GeV mass\nregion.

Thus in particular the quantum heterotic string\nhas vacua with higher rank than is possible in conformal field theory. When $k$\ninstantons collapse at the same point, the enhanced gauge symmetry is $Sp(k)$.\nThese results, which can be tested by comparison to Dirichlet five-branes of\nType I superstrings and to the ADHM construction of instantons, give the first\nexample for the heterotic string of a non-perturbative phenomenon that cannot\nbe turned off by making the coupling smaller.
