In practice, the direct application of QCD to\nreactions involving the structure of hadrons is complex because of the\ninterplay of nonperturbative effects such as color confinement and multi-quark\ncoherence. A crucial tool in analyzing such phenomena is the use of\nrelativistic light-cone quantum mechanics and Fock state methods to provide\ntractable and consistent treatments of relativistic many-body systems. We begin\nwith a brief introduction to light-cone field theory, stressing how it may\nallow the derivation of a constituent picture, analogous to the constituent\nquark model. The Fock state representation includes all quantum fluctuations of\nthe hadron wavefunction, including far off-shell configurations such as\nintrinsic charm and, in the case of nuclei, hidden color. The Fock state\ncomponents of the hadron with small transverse size, which dominate hard\nexclusive reactions, have small color dipole moments. Thus QCD predicts minimal\nabsorptive corrections, i.e., color transparency for quasi-elastic exclusive\nreactions in nuclear targets at large momentum transfer. In other applications,\nsuch as the calculation of the axial, magnetic, and quadrupole moments of light\nnuclei, the QCD Fock state description provides new insights which go well\nbeyond traditional hadronic and nuclear physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 1995 18:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that in $n>4$ dimensions,\nthe only consistent local interactions that can be added to the free action are\ngiven by functions of the field strength components and their derivatives (and\nthe Chern-Simons forms in $5$ mod $3$ dimensions). These interactions do not\nmodify the gauge invariance $B_{\\mu \\nu }^a\\rightarrow B_{\\mu \\nu }^a+\\partial\n_{[\\mu }\\Lambda _{\\nu ]}$ of the free theory. By contrast, there exist in $n=4$\ndimensions consistent interactions that deform the gauge symmetry of the free\ntheory in a non trivial way. These consistent interactions are uniquely given\nby the well-known Freedman-Townsend vertex. The method of proof uses the\ncohomological techniques developed recently in the Yang-Mills context to\nestablish theorems on the structure of renormalized gauge-invariant operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 1995 15:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
