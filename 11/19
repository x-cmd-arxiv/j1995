These\nquantities increase with decreasing Omega_o due to the earlier epoch of\nstructure formation in low-density cosmogonies; the results depend only on the\nquantity of gas heated to the virial temperature of collapsed objects and are\nindependent of the spatial distribution of the gas in the potential wells.\nSpecifically, we compare two models which reproduce the present-day abundance\nof clusters - a biased, critical universe and an unbiased, open model with\nOmega_o=0.3. We find that the mean y parameter approaches the current FIRAS\nlimit of y<2.5 10^{-5} for the open model, demonstrating the importance of\nimproving this limit on spectral distortions, and that the SZ source counts and\ncorresponding redshift distribution differ significantly between the two\ncosmogonies; millimeter surveys covering a large area should thus provide\ninteresting constraints on the density parameter of the Universe and on the\nevolution of the heated gas fraction in virialized objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 1995 19:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

We have considered a class of\ninitial conditions where the initial power spectrum at small $k$ has the form\n$k^n$ with $0 < n \\le 3$ and have numerically calculated the nonlinear\ncorrection to the two point correlation, its average over a sphere and the pair\nvelocity over a large dynamical range. We find that at small separations the\neffect of the nonlinear term is to enhance the clustering whereas at\nintermediate scales it can act to either increase or decrease the clustering.\nAt large scales we find a simple formula which gives a very good fit for the\nnonlinear correction in terms of the initial function. This formula explicitly\nexhibits the influence of small scales on large scales and because of this\ncoupling the perturbative treatment breaks down at large scales much before one\nwould expect it to if the nonlinearity were local in real space. We physically\ninterpret this formula in terms of a simple diffusion process. We have also\ninvestigated the case $n=0$ and we find that it differs from the other cases in\ncertain respects.

With ROSAT data, which provide spatial and spectral resolution at\nthe same time, good mass estimates can be obtained for various systems from\nsmall groups to very massive clusters covering a mass range of a few $10^{13}$\nto $4.6\\cdot10^{15}\\msol$. The gas to dark matter ratio for clusters is 10-30\\%\nwhile for groups slightly smaller values (3-25\\%) are found.
