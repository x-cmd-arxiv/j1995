In this paper we\ndiscuss a number of aspects of conifold transitions pertinent to both\nworldsheet and spacetime mirror symmetry. It is shown that the mirror transform\nbased on fractional transformations allows an extension of the mirror map to\nconifold boundary points of the moduli space of weighted Calabi-Yau manifolds.\nThe conifold points encountered in the mirror context are not amenable to an\nanalysis via the original splitting constructions. We describe the first\nexamples of such nonsplitting conifold transitions, which turn out to connect\nthe known web of Calabi-Yau spaces to new regions of the collective moduli\nspace. We then generalize the splitting conifold transition to weighted\nmanifolds and describe a class of connections between the webs of ordinary and\nweighted projective Calabi-Yau spaces. Combining these two constructions we\nfind evidence for a dual analog of conifold transitions in heterotic N$=$2\ncompactifications on K3$\\times $T$^2$ and in particular describe the first\nconifold transition of a Calabi-Yau manifold whose heterotic dual has been\nidentified by Kachru and Vafa.
