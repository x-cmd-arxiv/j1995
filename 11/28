It is likely\nthat the observed large-angular-scale anisotropies in the microwave background\nradiation are induced by cosmological perturbations of quantum-mechanical\norigin. Such perturbations are placed in squeezed vacuum quantum states and,\nhence, are characterized by large variances of their amplitude. The statistical\nproperties of the anisotropies should reflect the underlying statistics of the\nsqueezed vacuum quantum states. In this paper, the theoretical variances for\nthe temperature angular correlation function are described in detail. It is\nshown that they are indeed large and must be present in the observational data,\nif the anisotropies are truly caused by the perturbations of quantum-mechanical\norigin. Unfortunately, these large theoretical statistical uncertainties will\nmake the extraction of cosmological information from the measured anisotropies\na much more difficult problem than we wanted it to be.

The\nmodel, albeit non-minimal, remains very rigid due to the requirement of\nfiniteness. It is based on the $SU(5)$ gauge group and is UV finite to all\norders of perturbation theory. It contains three generations of the matter\nfields together with four pairs of Higgses. The requirement of UV finiteness\nfixes all the Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale. Imposing the condition of\nuniversality on the soft couplings at the Planck scale and then extending the\ncondition of finiteness to them, one gets a completely finite unified theory\nabove $M_{GUT}.$ This makes the fine-tuning procedure more meaningful and leads\nto the usual Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model below $M_{GUT}$. All the\nmasses of the ordinary particles including Higgses are obtained due to the\nHiggs mechanism at the electro-weak scale. The hierarchy of quark and lepton\nmasses is related to that of v.e.v.'s of the Higgs fields and is governed by\nthe Higgs mixing matrix in the generation space. Superpartners develop their\nmasses according to the RG equations starting from the soft terms at the Planck\nscale. The suggestion of complete finiteness and maximal simplicity of the\nunified theory leads to the connection between the initial values of soft SUSY\nbreaking parameters, namely $m_0^2=1/3m_{1/2}^2,\\ A_t=A_b=A_\\tau=-m_{1/2}, \\\nB=-m_{1/2}$, so that the number of free parameters is less than that of the\nMSSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 1995 17:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 1996 17:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The spectrum consists of magnetic\nvortices, global H charges and dyonic combinations exhibiting topological\nAharonov-Bohm interactions. Among other things, we review the Hopf algebra D(H)\nrelated to this residual discrete H gauge theory, which provides an unified\ndescription of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the aforementioned\nparticles. The implications of adding a Chern-Simons (CS) term to these models\nare also addressed. We recall that the CS actions for a compact gauge group G\nare classified by the cohomology group H^4(BG,Z). For finite groups H this\nclassification boils down to the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). Thus the\ndifferent CS actions for a finite group H are given by the inequivalent\n3-cocycles of H. It is argued that adding a CS action for the broken gauge\ngroup G leads to additional topological interactions for the vortices governed\nby a 3-cocycle for the residual finite gauge group H determined by a natural\nhomomorphism from H^4(BG,Z) to H^3(H,U(1)). Accordingly, the related Hopf\nalgebra D(H) is deformed into a quasi-Hopf algebra. These general\nconsiderations are illustrated by CS theories in which the direct product of\nsome U(1) gauge groups is broken to a finite subgroup H. It turns out that not\nall conceivable 3-cocycles for finite abelian gauge groups H can be obtained in\nthis way. Those that are not reached are the most interesting. A Z_2 x Z_2 x\nZ_2 CS theory given by such a 3-cocycle, for instance, is dual to an ordinary\ngauge theory with nonabelian gauge group the dihedral group of order eight.\nFinally, the CS theories with nonabelian finite gauge group a dihedral or\ndouble dihedral group are also discussed in full detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 1995 20:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
