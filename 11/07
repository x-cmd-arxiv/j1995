Fourier\ndecomposition of the disk light reveals that the radial distribution of power\ndepends on wavelength, which in turn implies that the spiral structure traced\nin the visual (i.e. young population I and dust) is different from the one\ndetected at 2 microns (i.e. old stellar disk). We observe radial modulation of\nthe power and a dependency of power with wavelength that are consistent with\nmodal theory of spiral structure.\n  A central motivation for our research is the fundamental idea of density wave\ntheory that the passage of a spiral density wave triggers star formation. We\nhave found a stellar population age gradient consistent with this scenario in a\nreddening-free, red supergiant-sensitive, Q-like photometric parameter at 6 kpc\ngalactocentric distance across one of the arms of M99. We rule out that the\nchange in this parameter, Q(r_SJgi), across the arm is mainly due to dust. The\ndifference in Q(r_SJgi) going from the interarm regions to the arms also\nindicates that arms cannot be due exclusively to crowding of stellar orbits.\n  We present the first measurement of Omega_p, the angular speed of the spiral\npattern, and of the location of the corotation radius, derived from the drift\nvelocity of the young stars away from their birth site. The measured Q(r_SJgi)\nimplies a star formation rate for M99 within the range of 10-20 M_odot/yr; a\ndisk stellar mass surface density of ~80 M_odot/pc^2; and a maximum\ncontribution of ~20 percent from red supergiants to the K' light in a small\nregion, and much smaller on average.

No\ncomplete formalism accounts for such processes yet. We study a simple\nlowest-order QCD model for their description. Concentrating on Higgs\nproduction, we show that the calculation of the cross section pp -> pp H can be\nembedded into existing models which successfully account for diffractive data.\nWe extend those models to take into account single and double diffractive cross\nsections pp -> H X1 X2 with a gap between the fragments X1 and X2. Using\nconservative scenarios, we evaluate the uncertainties in our calculation, and\nstudy the dependence of the cross section on the gap width. We predict that\nHiggs production within a gap of 4 units of rapidity is about 0.3 pb for a 100\nGeV Higgs at the Tevatron, and almost 2 pb for a 400 GeV Higgs within a gap of\n6 units at the LHC with 14 TeV beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 1995 00:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
