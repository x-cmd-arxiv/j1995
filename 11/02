Our main\npoint concerns the importance of rotation for the UV emission line shapes in\nsuch systems. In particular, we show that the narrowing of the UV emission\nlines in V347 Pup during eclipse can be easily explained by the eclipse of the\ninnermost part of the wind by the secondary and the resulting reduction in the\ncontribution of rotational broadening to the width of the lines. During the\neclipse, the residual line flux is very sensitive to the maximal temperature of\ndisk radiation. Good fits for reasonable mass-loss rates have been obtained for\nmaximum disk temperatures of 50,000 degrees.

Due to their informational\ncompleteness, these quantum frames are capable of taking over the role played\nby complete sets of observables in conventional quantum theory. The propagation\nof quantum-geometric fields proceeds by path integral methods, based on\nparallel transport along broken paths consisting of arcs of geodesics of the\nLevi-Civita connection. The formulation of quantum gravity within this\nframework necessitates the transition to quantum superframe bundles and a\nquantum gravitational supergroup capable of incorporating diffeomorphism\ninvariance into the framework. This results in a geometric version of quantum\ngravity which shares some conceptual features with covariant as well as with\ncanonical gravity, but which avoids the foundational and the mathematical\ndifficulties encountered by these two approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 1995 16:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As first discovered by Naculich, it is found\nthat the bosonic perturbations that destabilize the string give a mass to the\nzero modes and also lift their degeneracy. The effect of the zero modes on the\nstability of the string is discussed qualitatively and we argue that the\nfermionic vacuum instability found by Naculich should lead to a distortion of\nthe bosonic string but not be responsible for decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 1995 09:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
