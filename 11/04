We computed libraries of about 7000 orbits in\neach of two triaxial models with gamma=1 (weak cusp) and gamma=2 (strong cusp);\nthese two models have density profiles similar to those of the core and\npower-law galaxies observed by HST. Both mass models have short-to-long axis\nratios of 1:2 and are maximally triaxial. A large fraction of the orbits in\nboth model potentials are stochastic, as evidenced by their non-zero Liapunov\nexponents. We show that most of the stochastic orbits in the strong- cusp\npotential diffuse relatively quickly through their allowed phase-space volumes,\non time scales of 100 - 1000 dynamical times. Stochastic orbits in the\nweak-cusp potential diffuse more slowly, often retaining their box-like shapes\nfor 1000 dynamical times or longer. Attempts to construct self- consistent\nsolutions using just the regular orbits failed for both mass models.\nQuasi-equilibrium solutions that include the stochastic orbits exist for both\nmodels; however, real galaxies constructed in this way would evolve near the\ncenter due to the continued mixing of the stochastic orbits. We attempted to\nconstruct more nearly stationary models in which stochastic phase space was\nuniformly populated at low energies.

This novel condition is a natural\ngeneralization of the relativistic spectrum condition in the vacuum theory and\nhas similar consequences. In combination with the condition of locality it\ngives rise to a Kaellen--Lehmann type representation of thermal propagators\nwith specific regularity properties. Possible applications of the results and\nsome open problems are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 1995 16:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
