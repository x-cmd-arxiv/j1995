We quantize this theory using the\nbackground field method and examine its renormalizability at one-loop by\nanalyzing all the relevant diagrams. We find that, for a suitable choice of the\ngauge field propagators, this theory is one-loop renormalizable in $3+1$\ndimensions. This pure abelian Kac-Moody gauge theory in $3+1$ dimensions has\nonly one running coupling constant and the theory is asymptotically free. When\nfermions are added the number of independent couplings increases and a richer\nstructure is obtained. Finally, we note some features of the theory which\nsuggest its possible relevance to the study of anisotropic condensed matter\nsystems, in particular that of high-temperature superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 1995 08:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
