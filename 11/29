For sharp-time fields this fact implies that the\nground-state expectation functional also becomes Gaussian in the continuum\nlimit. To overcome these consequences of the central limit theorem, an\nauxiliary, nonclassical potential is appended to the original lattice form of\nthe model and parameters are tuned so that a generalized Poisson field\ndistribution emerges in the continuum limit for the ground-state probability\ndistribution. As a consequence, the sharp-time expectation functional is\ninfinitely divisible, but the Hamiltonian operator is such, in the general\ncase, that the generating functional for the space-time smeared field is not\ninfinitely divisible in Minkowski space. This feature permits the models in\nquestion to escape a manifestly trivial scattering matrix imposed on all\ninfinitely divisible covariant Minkowski fields. Two sequentially related\nproposals for an alternative lattice formulation of interacting covariant\nmodels in four and more space-time dimensions are analyzed in some detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 1995 20:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
