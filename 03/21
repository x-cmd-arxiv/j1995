After the hydrogen has\nrecombined, as the external ionizing UV flux decreases and the metal abundance\n$Z$ increases, the HI, initially in the warm phase ($T\\simgt 5000$ K), makes a\ntransition to the cool phase ($T\\simlt 100$ K). The minimum abundance $Z_{min}$\nfor which this phase transition takes place in a small fraction of the Hubble\ntime decreases rapidly with increasing gas column density. Therefore in the\n``anemic'' disk galaxies, where $N_{HI}$ is up to ten times smaller than for\nnormal large spirals, the onset of the cool HI phase is delayed. The onset of\ngravitational instability is also delayed, since these objects are more likely\nto be gravitationally stable in the warm phase than progenitors of today's\nlarge spiral galaxies. The first substantial burst of star formation may occur\nonly as late as at redshifts $z \\sim 0.5$ and give a temporary high peak\nluminosity, which may be related to the ``faint blue objects\".
