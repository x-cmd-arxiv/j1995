The fields were\nobserved through two broad-band (\\V\\ and \\I) and two narrow-band (\\CN\\ and\n\\TiO) filters. The broad-band data were used to construct \\IvsVI\\\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and, in some of our fields, we found\nsignificant numbers of stars in the Cepheid instability strip. A distance\nmodulus for the Cepheids in the middle field was found that agreed well with\nother values in the literature values. The width of the giant branch (GB) in\nthe \\IvsVI\\ CMD of all 5 fields was investigated, and we show that in four of\nthe fields a likely explanation for the GB width is a combination of {\\it both}\nmetallicity and mass variations. Using the broad-band data, the asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) luminosity functions (LFs) were measured in the five fields,\nand we show that differences exist between these LFs. We speculate on how the\ndifferent star forming histories in the fields may lead to the observed AGB LFs\nand GB widths. Using the narrow-band data along with the broad-band data we\nseparated the AGB stars into carbon-rich (C) and oxygen-rich (M) types. The\ncarbon stars LFs were used to obtain an estimate for the distance modulus of\nM31 which agrees with the value derived from Cepheids. The ratio of C- to\nM-stars (C/M) is believed to be an indicator of gaseous chemical abundance at\nthe time of formation of these stars. We show that the C/M ratio increases\nsmoothly with galactocentric distance, suggesting an inverse correlation with\nmetallicity. This is the first demonstration of this effect within a single\nextragalactic system. We find that differences in the width of the GB and the\nAGB LFs do not significantly affect the C/M ratio. We consider the effect of\nthe increasing C/M ratio on the ISM in M31, and cite evidence in favor of a\nmodel where the grain composition in M31 is a function of galactocentric\ndistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 1995 00:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

As a byproduct, a simple\nderivation of the `mass spectrum' for the Klein-Gordon field is presented, but\nit is also shown that there is a complete additional spectrum of negative\n`masses'. Finally, two major reasons are presented against the viability of\nthis alternative proposal: a) It does not lead to the correct energy spectrum\nfor the hydrogen atom. b) For field models, the standard quantum theory cannot\nbe recovered from this alternative description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 1995 16:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 1995 17:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
