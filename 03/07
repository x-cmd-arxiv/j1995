The investigation of a\nnumber of morphological models showed that M94 has a weak central stellar bar\nof 0.7 kpc major axis length which comprises about 14 per cent of the total\nlight within 20 arcsec. By means of longslit spectroscopy the kinematics of gas\nand stars in this region were investigated. The stellar kinematics reveal the\nexistence of a small spheroidal bulge with v/sigma of about 0.8. The stellar\nvelocity field in this region is approximately axisymmetric, showing that the\neffects of the bar on the kinematics of the hot component are relatively small.\nThe warm gas in the bar region shows global and local deviations from the\nstellar kinematics, but outside the central bar fits into the general HI\nvelocity field. Model calculations of closed orbits for gas in the potential of\nthe bar perturbation and axisymmetric disk and bulge predict large non-circular\nmotions for cold gas in equilibrium flow.

Our analysis\ncomprises a complete set of physical quantities based on the nonobservation of\nflavour-violating $Z$-boson decays, lepton universality in the decays $Z\\to\nl\\bar{l}$, and universality of lepton asymmetries at the $Z$ peak. It is found\nthat these quantities form a set of complementary observables and may hence\nconstrain the parameter space of the theories. Non-SM contributions of\nnew-physics interactions to $R_b=\\Gamma(Z\\to b\\bar{b})/\\Gamma(Z\\to\n\\mbox{hadrons})$ are briefly discussed within these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 1995 16:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

In another\ndevelopment it has been shown that when $H$ and $H'$ are both subalgebras of a\nLie algebra $G$ with $H'\\subset H$, then classically the $W(G,H)$ algebra can\nbe obtained by performing a secondary hamiltonian reduction on $W(G,H')$. In\nthis paper we show that the corresponding statement is true also for quantum\nhamiltonian reduction when the simple roots of $H'$ can be chosen as a subset\nof the simple roots of $H$. As an application, we show that the quantum\nsecondary reductions provide a natural framework to study and explain the\nlinearization of the $W$ algebras, as well as a great number of new\nrealizations of $W$ algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 1995 14:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 1995 09:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 1996 10:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In particular, we look at the\ncritical points (least ordinals moved) of the elementary embeddings; simple\nstatements about these ordinals can be reformulated as purely algebraic\nstatements concerning the left distributive law. Previously, lower bounds on\nthe number of critical points have been used to show that certain such\nalgebraic statements, known to follow from large cardinals, require more than\nPrimitive Recursive Arithmetic to prove. Here we present the first few steps of\na program that, if it can be carried to completion, should give exact\ncomputations of the number of critical points, thereby showing that hypotheses\nonly slightly beyond Primitive Recursive Arithmetic would suffice to prove the\naforementioned algebraic statements.\n  Some of the main results here were discovered through examination of bit\npatterns from extensive calculations in the finite algebras; this may be the\nfirst serious example of computer-aided research in the theory of large\ncardinals. The results in this paper have a large overlap with results of A.\nDrapal, which were obtained independently at about the same time, but from a\nquite different point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
