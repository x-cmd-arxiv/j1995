A Cauchy problem with initial data that describe the\nscattering of $n$ vortices is formulated. It is shown that this Cauchy problem\nhas a unique global finite-energy solution. The symmetry of the solution and\nthe form of the local analytic solution then show that $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$\nscattering is realised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 1995 10:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

We show that the structure of the stable phase is well described by\nfreezing in a small number of unstable phonons into the cubic phase. We use the\nfrequencies of these unstable modes to estimate transition temperatures for\ncubic--tetragonal and tetragonal--orthorhombic phase transitions. These are\ninvestigated further to find that the coupling with the strain suggests that\nphonons give a better representation than rigid unit modes. The phonons of an\nintermediate tetragonal phase were found to be stable except for two rotational\nmodes. The eigenvectors of the most unstable mode of each of the cubic and\ntetragonal phases account for all the positional parameters of the orthorhombic\nphase. The phase boundary for the orthorhombic--tetragonal transition\nintersects possible mantle geotherms, suggesting that the tetragonal phase may\nbe present in the lower mantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 1995 10:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Moreover, a correspondence-principle part of the\nS-matrix is normally separated out in quantum electrodynamics in order to\nobtain a remainder that can be treated perturbatively. But this separation, as\nusually performed, causes an apparent breakdown of the correspondence principle\nand the associated pole-factorization property. This breakdown is spurious. It\nis shown in this article, and a companion, in the context of a special case,\nhow to extract a distinguished part of the S-matrix that meets the\ncorrespondence-principle and pole-factorization requirements. In a second\ncompanion paper the terms of the remainder are shown to vanish in the\nappropriate macroscopic limits.
