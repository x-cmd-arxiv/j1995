Using resonant photoemission we study how this\nchemical substitution affects the electronic structure of the material. For the\npartial Cu-density of states at E_F and in the region of the valence band we\nobserve no significant difference between a pure superconducting sample and an\ninsulating sample with 60% Pr for Ca. This suggests that the states responsible\nfor superconductivity are predomi- nately O-states. The partial Pr-4f density\nof states was extracted utilizing the Super- Koster-Kronig Pr 4d-4f resonance.\nIt consists of a single peak at 1.36eV binding energy. The peak shows a\nstrongly assymetric Doniach-Sunjic line- shape indicating the presence of a\ncontinuum of electronic states with sharp cut off at E_F even in this\ninsulating sample. This finding excludes a bandgap in the insulating sample and\nsupports the existance of a mobility gap caused by spatial localization of the\ncarriers. The presence of such carriers at the Pr-site, between the CuO_2\nplanes shows that the electronic structure is not purely 2-dimensional but that\nthere is a finite interlayer coupling. The resonance enhancement of the\nphotoemission cross section, at the Pr-4d threshold, was studied for the Pr-4f\nand for Cu-states. Both the Pr-4f and the Cu-states show a Fano-like resonance.\nThis resonance of Cu-states with Pr-states is another indication of coupling\nbetween the the Pr-states and those in the CuO_2 plane. Because of the\nstatistical distribution of the Pr-ions this coupling leads to a non-periodic\npotential for the states in the CuO_2 plane which can lead to localization and\nthus to the observed metal-insulator transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 1995 16:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We show that there exists\nan infinite number of Casimir operators, indexed by integers $p > 1$ in the\nundeformed case and by $p \\in Z$ in the deformed case, which obey quadratic\nrelations. The construction of the dual superalgebra of functions on\n$SL_{qs}(1|2)$ is also given and higher tensor product representations are\ndiscussed.
