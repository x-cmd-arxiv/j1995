The summations that are\ninvolved converge only conditionally and care has to be taken in selecting the\nappropriate procedure to define the limits. The Ewald method is a standard\nmethod for obtaining Coulomb forces, but this method is rather slow, since it\ndepends on the square of the number of atoms in a unit cell. In this paper we\nhave adapted the plane-wise summation method for the evaluation of Coulomb\nforces. The use of this method allows for larger computational cells in\nmolecular dynamics calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 1995 22:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The tractability of few-nucleon calculations, illustrated by very\nrecent solutions for $A = 2-6$, is shown to follow from power counting based on\nchiral Lagrangians. The latter predicts the suppression of $N$-body forces, as\noriginally shown by Weinberg. Isospin violation in the nuclear force is\nsimilarly analyzed using the results of van Kolck, and this is shown to be\nconsistent with results from the Nijmegen phase-shift analysis. Conventional\n$\\rho - \\omega$ and $\\pi - \\eta$ mixing models with on-shell mixing strength\nare not inconsistent with naive power counting. Meson-exchange currents\ncalculated in chiral perturbation theory are in good agreement with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 1995 23:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 1996 19:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
