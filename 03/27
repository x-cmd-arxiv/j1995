These results imply that either there is no evolutionary relation\nbetween these two stars, or that there is an unknown mass loss mechanism. To\ninvestigate possible evolutionary links between these objects, we computed\nevolutionary sequences of white dwarf models including time-dependent\ndiffusion. Our initial model is based on the PG~1159 pulsational data, and has\na surface composition of 30% helium, 35% carbon, and 35% oxygen. Below this is\na thin transition zone where the helium fraction falls to zero. As expected,\ndiffusion caused a separation of the elements; a thickening surface layer of\nnearly pure helium overlays a deepening transition zone where the composition\nreturns to the original surface composition. When the model reached the\ntemperature range of GD~358 and the pulsating DB white dwarfs, this pure helium\nsurface layer was 3x10^-6 stellar masses deep. The resulting evolved model is\nvery similar to the model used by Bradley and Winget (1994) to match the\npulsation observations of GD 358.

Our model\nconsists of finite width barriers and nonlinearities are dealt with separately\nin the barriers and in the well, both with and without applied electric fields.\nWe study a wide range of nonlinearity coupling values.
