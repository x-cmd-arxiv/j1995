As\nis shown in our paper (and in independent work of Tirza Hirst and D. Harel from\na different angle) there is no firm connection between these complexities,\nnamely finite problems of equal complexity can have radically different\ncomplexity for the infinite versions and vice versa. Furthermore, the\ncomplexity of an infinite counterpart can depend heavily on precisely how the\nfinite problem is rephrased in the infinite case.\n  The finite problems we address include colorability of graphs and existence\nof subgraph isomorphisms. In particular, we give three infinite versions of the\n3-colorability problem that vary considerably in their recursion theoretic and\nproof theoretic complexity. Additionally, we show that three subgraph\nisomorphism problems of varying finite complexity have infinite versions with\nidentical recursion theoretic and proof theoretic content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
