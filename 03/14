A\ngeneralization that is applicable to continuous stratification is suggested\nwhich leads to the estimates: V ~ 1/(beta T^2); k ~ beta*T; D ~\n1/{[beta^2][T^3]} where T is a time-scale determined by the environment; in\nparticular, it equals lambda/U in the two-layer model and N/(fS) in a\ncontinuous flow with uniform shear S and stratification N.

For a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forced\noscillation with a period equal to the orbital period ($T$). For an eccentric\norbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximately\nas the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the mode\nfrequency and a `static' term that follows the time dependence of the tidal\nforcing function. The oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing\n$\\b$ (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period),\nwhereas the `static' term is independent of $\\b$. For small $\\b$ modes ($\\b\n\\approx 1$), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the mode\namplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. For large $\\b$ modes ($\\b \\gta$ a\nfew), the oscillatory term is very small compared to the `static' term, in\nwhich case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distance\ncubed. For main sequence stars, $p$, $f$, and low order $g$-modes generally\nhave large $\\b$ and hence small amplitudes of oscillation.

In particular it enables the partition functions\nappearing in the semiclassical approximation for the Witten-invariant to be\nevaluated in the most general case.
