These spectra show strong Balmer absorption\nlines like those observed in A-type stars, as expected if the object is a young\nglobular cluster. The age estimated from the strength of the Balmer lines is\nabout 0.5 Gyr, although ages ranging from 0.1 Gyr to 0.9 Gyr can not be\nconfidently excluded given current models of stellar populations. If these\nestimated ages are adopted for the young cluster population of NGC 1275 as a\nwhole, the fading predicted by stellar populations models gives a luminosity\nfunction which is consistent with that of the Galactic globular cluster system\nconvolved with the observational selection function for the NGC 1275 system. We\nalso use the equivalent widths of the Mg $b$ and Fe 5270 features to constrain\nthe metallicity of the young cluster. Combining these absorption-line widths\nwith the age estimates from the Balmer lines and stellar population models, we\nfind a metallicity of roughly solar based on the Mg $b$ index and somewhat\nhigher for the Fe 5270 index. The radial velocity of the absorption lines of\nthe cluster spectrum is offset from the emission lines of the galaxy spectrum\nat the same position by $-130$ \\kms, providing further evidence for the\nidentification of the object as a globular cluster, and opening up the future\npossibility of studying the kinematics of young cluster systems. The discovery\nof objects with the characteristics of young globular clusters in NGC 1275,\nwhich shows evidence of a recent interaction or merger, supports the hypothesis\nthat galaxy interactions and mergers are favorable sites for the formation of\nglobular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 1995 06:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The SO(3) embedding leads to new particle-like solutions and black\nholes, sharing many features with the SU(2) solutions. In particular, there are\nalways two branches of solutions, forming a cusp at a critical coupling\nconstant. The regular SO(3) solutions have even topological charge $B$. The\nmass of the $B=2$ SO(3) solutions is less than twice the mass of the $B=1$\nSU(2) solutions. We conjecture, that the lowest SO(3) branches correspond to\nstable particle-like solutions and stable black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 1995 15:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
