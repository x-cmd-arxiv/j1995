We bound DM by noting that\nsuch a distribution would increase the effective mass of the sun as seen by the\nouter planets and by finding the uncertainty in that effective mass for Uranus\nand Neptune in fits to the JPL Developmental Ephermeris residuals, including\noptical data and those two planets' Voyager 2 flybys. We extend our previous\nprocedure by fitting more parameters of the developmental ephemerides.\nAdditionally, we present here the values for Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1\nand 2 Jupiter ranging normal points (and incorporate these data as well). Our\nprincipal result is to limit DM in spherically symmetric distributions in orbit\nabout the sun interior to Neptune's orbit to less than an earth mass and\ninterior to Uranus' orbit to about 1/6 of an earth's mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 1995 21:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

This can\nnaturally be hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale in a dynamical model,\ngiving small fluctuations without any fine tuning of parameters.
