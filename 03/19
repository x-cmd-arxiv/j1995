Large radiative corrections are induced by\n$F$-term (or $D$-term) density, which dominates the inflationary universe and\nstrongly breaks supersymmetry. In such theories it is difficult to treat\nsquarks and sleptons as the light fields in the inflationary period. In the\ngeneric supergravity theories all flat directions, including moduli, are\ngetting curvature of order the Hubble constant.
