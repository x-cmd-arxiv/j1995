In these models, low surface\nbrightness galaxies form at late times from small initial overdensities, and\nmake up most of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. Because there\nare tremendous observational biases against finding low surface brightness\ngalaxies, the observed faint end of the galaxy luminosity function may easily\nfall short of predictions, if hierarchical structure formation is correct. We\ncalculate the number density and mass density in collapsed objects as a\nfunction of baryonic surface density and redshift, and show that the mass in\nrecently formed low surface brightness galaxies can be comparable to the mass\nbound into ``normal'' high surface brightness galaxies. Because of their low\ngas surface densities, these galaxies are easily ionized by the UV background\nand are not expected to appear in HI surveys. Low surface brightness galaxies\n(LSBs) are not a special case of galaxy formation and are perhaps better viewed\nas a continuance of the Hubble sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 1995 04:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
