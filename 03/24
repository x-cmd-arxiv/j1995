The radiative corrections\nintroduce natural line-widths into the energy denominators of all propagators,\nas well as into the time-development exponentials of all scattering states\ncorresponding to external lines. Since initial and final scattering states may\nnow decay, it is logically necessary to compute scattering amplitudes for a\nfinite time-lapse between the preparation of the initial state and the\nmeasurement of the final state. Strict energy conservation, which appeared in\nprevious formulations of the theory, must thus be abandoned.
