Only by adopting\nentirely novel technologies that allow one to build large and inexpensive\ntelescopes can we achieve truly large improvements. This may come at the\nexpense of versatility and may entail changes in the observing strategies\nastronomers are now accustomed to. I build my case around a new technology,\nliquid mirrors, that although in its infancy has achieved credibility. I argue\nthat forthcoming technological improvements will make Liquid Mirror Telescopes\n(LMTs) nearly as versatile as conventional telescopes. I address the issue of\nthe fields accessible to LMTs equipped with novel optical correctors. Optical\ndesign work and exploratory laboratory work indicate that a single LMT should\nbe able to access, with excellent images, subregions anywhere inside fields as\nlarge as 45 degrees.\n  As a practical example of what an LMT can do with the present technology, I\nexamine the expected performance of a 5-m liquid mirror telescope, presently\nunder construction, dedicated to a cosmological survey. It is rather\nimpressive, due to the fact that the instrument works full-time on a four-year\nsurvey: Spectrophotometry reaches B=24 with a signal to noise ratio of 10\nwithin a 200\\AA bandpass for all objects within 300 square degrees and\nwide-band photometry reaches about B=27. I give three examples of cosmological\nprojects that can be done with the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 1995 19:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show here that\nthis is not the case by giving a simple class of examples of Markovian\nevolution laws where rapid evolution from pure states to mixed states occurs\nfor a wide class of states with appropriate properties at the ``Planck scale\",\nsuitable locality and causality properties hold for all states, and the\ndeviations from ordinary dynamics (and, in particular, violations of\nenergy-momentum conservation) are unobservably small for all states which one\ncould expect to produce in a laboratory. In addition, we argue (via\nconsideration of other, non-Markovian models) that conservation of energy and\nmomentum for all states is not fundamentally incompatible with causality in\ndynamical models in which pure states evolve to mixed states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 1995 19:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 1995 20:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 May 1995 18:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
