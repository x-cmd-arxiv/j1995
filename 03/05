To focus the\ndiscussion, I concentrate on the issue of the value of the density $\\Omega_0$\nin currently popular cosmological models in which most of the dark matter is\ncold, especially Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) and flat low- $\\Omega$ CDM with\na Cosmological Constant ($\\Lambda$CDM). The evidence would favor a small\n$\\Omega_0 \\approx 0.3$ if (1) the Hubble parameter actually has the high value\n$h \\approx 0.8$ favored by many observers, and the age of the universe $t_0\n\\geq 13$ Gy; or (2) the baryonic/total mass ratio in clusters is actually $\\sim\n20$\\%, about 3-4 times larger than expected for standard Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis in an $\\Omega=1$ universe, and standard BBN is actually right\nin predicting that the density of ordinary matter $\\Omega_b$ lies in the range\n$0.009 \\leq \\Omega_b h^2 \\leq 0.02$. The evidence would favor $\\Omega=1$ if (1)\nthe POTENT analysis of galaxy peculiar velocity data is right, in particular\nregarding outflows from voids or the inability to obtain the present-epoch\nnon-Gaussian density distribution from Gaussian initial fluctuations in a\nlow-$\\Omega$ universe; or (2) the preliminary report from LSND indicating a\nneutrino mass $\\geq 2.4$ eV is right, since that would be too much hot dark\nmatter to allow significant structure formation in a low-$\\Omega$ $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel. Statistics on gravitational lensing of quasars provide a strong upper\nlimit on $\\Lambda$. Reliable data on all of these issues is becoming available\nso rapidly today that a clear decision between these alternatives may be\npossible within the next few years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 1995 19:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 1995 17:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
