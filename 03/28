Here we compare the Noether charge approach\n(defined for any diffeomorphism invariant Lagrangian theory) with various\nEuclidean methods, specifically, (i) the microcanonical ensemble approach of\nBrown and York, (ii) the closely related approach of Ba\\~nados, Teitelboim, and\nZanelli which ultimately expresses black hole entropy in terms of the Hilbert\naction surface term, (iii) another formula of Ba\\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli\n(also used by Susskind and Uglum) which views black hole entropy as conjugate\nto a conical deficit angle, and (iv) the pair creation approach of Garfinkle,\nGiddings, and Strominger. All of these approaches have a more restrictive\ndomain of applicability than the Noether charge approach. Specifically,\napproaches (i) and (ii) appear to be restricted to a class of theories\nsatisfying certain properties listed in section 2; approach (iii) appears to\nrequire the Lagrangian density to be linear in the curvature; and approach (iv)\nrequires the existence of suitable instanton solutions. However, we show that\nwithin their domains of applicability, all of these approaches yield results in\nagreement with the Noether charge approach. In the course of our analysis, we\ngeneralize the definition of Brown and York's quasilocal energy to a much more\ngeneral class of diffeomorphism invariant, Lagrangian theories of gravity. In\nan appendix, we show that in an arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theory of\ngravity, the ``volume term\" in the ``off-shell\" Hamiltonian associated with a\ntime evolution vector field $t^a$ always can be expressed as the spatial\nintegral of $t^a {\\cal C}_a$, where ${\\cal C}_a = 0$ are the constraints\nassociated with the diffeomorphism invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 1995 20:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In its original (minimal) form, dualization is restricted to models\nwherein it is possible to define a dynamical quantized conserved charge. We\ngeneralize the usual dualization prescription to include systems with dynamical\nnon--conserved quantum currents. Bosonization based on this extended\ndualization requires the introduction of an additional rank $0$ (scalar) field\ntogether with the usual antisymmetric tensor field of rank $(D-2)$. Our\ngeneralized dualization prescription permits one to clearly distinguish the\narbitrariness in the bosonization from the arbitrariness in the quantization of\nthe system. We study the bosonization of four--fermion interactions with large\nmass in arbitrary dimension. First, we observe that dualization permits one to\nformally bosonize these models by invoking the bosonization of the free massive\nDirac fermion and adding some extra model--dependent bosonic terms. Secondly,\nwe explore the potential of extended dualization by considering the particular\ncase of \\underbar{chiral} four--fermion interactions. Here minimal dualization\nis inadequate for calculating the extra bosonic terms. We demonstrate the\nutility of extended dualization by successfully completing the bosonization of\nthis chiral model. Finally, we consider two examples in two dimensions which\nilluminate the utility of using extended dualization by showing how\nquantization ambiguities in a fermionic theory propagate into the bosonized\nversion.
