In contrast, electron\nneutrinos and antineutrinos ($\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$) are frequently absorbed\nand produced in charged-current mediated reactions with nucleons. Therefore the\nemergent $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$ originate from layers with lower temperatures\nfurther out in the star and are emitted with much lower characteristic spectral\ntemperatures. In addition, a major contribution to the $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$\nopacities is due to absorptions, while the opacity of $\\nu_x$ is strongly\ndominated by scattering reactions with nucleons and nuclei in which the $\\nu_x$\nenergy is (essentially) conserved. Therefore the $\\nu_x$ distribution is nearly\nisotropic when $\\nu_x$ decouple energetically and their outward diffusion is\nslowed down. In a generalized form to include this effect, the Stefan-Boltzmann\nRadiation Law can account for both the facts that $\\nu_e$ ($\\bar\\nu_e$) and\n$\\nu_x$ emerge from the star with similar luminosities but with very different\ncharacteristic spectral temperatures. Simple analytical expressions to estimate\nthe effect are given. If, as recently argued, even at densities significantly\nbelow nuclear matter density neutral-current scatterings were associated with\nconsiderable energy transfer between neutrino and target particle, one might\nexpect spectral temperatures of $\\nu_x$ much closer to those of $\\nu_e$ and\n$\\bar\\nu_e$.

Secondly, the time variabilities of\nthe bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the\ncurvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the\nrequirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently\nsmall to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,\nwe discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight\nbright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose\npositional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity\nfunction of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host\ngalaxy.
