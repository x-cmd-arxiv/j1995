Scaling relations exist and the critical\nexponents have simple geometric interpretations. Hartle-Hawkings wave\nfunctionals as well as reparametrization invariant correlation functions which\ndepend on the geodesic distance can be calculated. The discretized approach\nmakes sense even in higher dimensional space-time. Although analytic solutions\nare still missing in the higher dimensional case, numerical studies reveal an\ninteresting structure and allow the identification of a fixed point where we\ncan hope to define a genuine non-perturbative theory of four-dimensional\nquantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 1995 14:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
