The observations and data analysis have been described in\na companion paper (Santos-Lle\\'o et al. 1994; Paper~1). The active nucleus in\nthis galaxy is strongly and rapidly variable in all wavebands, implying that\nthe continuum source is unusually compact. Its energy distribution from\n1.2~$\\mu$m to 1200~\\AA\\/ obeys a power-law whose index is significantly steeper\nthan is usual in Seyfert's or QSO's; the ``big bump'' is either absent or\nshifted to wavelengths shorter than 1200~\\AA\\/. The variations of the\nsoft-X~ray {\\em excess\\/} do not correlate with those of the UV or hard X-ray\ncontinuum. The far UV and optical fluxes are well correlated, while the\ncorrelation between the hard X-rays and 1447 \\AA\\ continuum is only marginally\nsignificant. Moreover, the optical flux cannot lag behind the UV by more than 6\ndays. These results cannot be accommodated in the framework of the standard\ngeometrically thin accretion disk model. Rather, they suggest that the bulk of\nthe UV and optical flux originates from thermal reprocessing of X-rays\nirradiating the disk. The soft X-ray excess is probably the only spectral\ncomponent which originates from viscous dissipation inside the disk and the\nnear infrared is probably emitted by hot dust heated by the UV radiation. Such\na model is consistent with NGC~4593 having a relatively small black-hole mass\nof the order of $2\\times10^{6}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ as inferred from the line\nvariability study. The high ionization/excitation emission lines are very broad\nand strongly variable and their variations correlate with those of the\ncontinuum. The low excitation lines are significantly narrower and remain\nconstant within the accuracy of our measurements. These results suggest a\nstratified BLR, where the degree of ionization and the velocity dispersion of\nthe gas increase toward small radii.

The massive four-dimensional\ndouble-bound states (Bogomolny states) are shown to form a light-like\nrepresentation of ten-dimensional supersymmetry. The single-bound states form a\nmassive representation (centrino multiplet) of a four-dimensional\nsupersymmetry. The first component of the centrino multiplet is identified with\nextreme black holes with regular horizon which have one quarter of unbroken\nsupersymmetry. The centrino multiplet includes a massive spin 3/2 state, the\ncentrino, as a highest spin state.\n  Existence of massive black hole supermultiplets may affect the massless\nsector of the theory. Assuming that gluino condensate is formed one can study\nits properties. The bilinear combination of covariantly constant Killing\nspinors supplies the possible form for a gluino condensate.

Because of the universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, the splittings of all\nmultiplets are given by the product of charge times internal helicity\noperators. As a result such compactifications have two remarkable and robust\nfeatures: {\\it (a)} they can reconcile {\\it chirality} with {\\it extended}\nlow-energy supersymmetry in the limit of large tori, and {\\it (b)} they can\ntrigger gauge-symmetry breaking, via Nielsen-Olesen instabilities, at a scale\ntied classically to $m_{SUSY}$. I exhibit a compactification of the $SO(32)$\nsuperstring, in which magnetic fields break spontaneously $N=4$ supersymmetry,\nproduce the standard-model gauge group with three chiral families of quarks and\nleptons, and trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. I discuss supertrace\nrelations and the ensuing ultraviolet softness. As with other known mechanisms\nof supersymmetry breaking, the one proposed here faces two open problems: the\nthreat to perturbative calculability in the decompactification limit, and the\nproblem of gravitational stability and in particular of the cosmological\nconstant. I explain, however, why a good classical description of the vacuum\nmay require small tadpoles for the dilaton, moduli and metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 1995 08:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
