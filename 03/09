The models include HDM and CDM models as well as\ndouble power-law models. We discuss in detail the impact of model parameters\nsuch as the large scale and small scale power and the position and height of\nthe maxima of the power spectra on the predicted structure. The best agreement\nwith observations was observed in the model with the Harrison-Zeldovich\nspectrum on large scales, a power index $n\\approx -1.5$ on small scales, and a\nmaximum of the power spectrum at $\\approx 130$~\\Mpc. In this model the\ndistribution of masses of clusters and superclusters, the correlation function\nof clusters, and the void distribution reproduce well the respective observed\ndistributions. We also investigated the dynamical evolution of the\nsupercluster-void structure.
