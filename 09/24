We restrict\nourselves to gauge configurations with the $A$ field going to zero at infinity\nin Euclidean space; and thus restrict gauge transformations to those with $U$\nthe identity at infinity. For each finite cutoff one gets a strictly\ngauge-invariant expression for the Weyl determinant. Full Euclidean invariance\nis only to be sought in the limit of removing the cutoff. We expect the limit\nto be Euclidean invariant, but this has not yet been proved. One need not\nenforce the no-anomaly condition on the representation of the gauge group!
