For $x=y$ (the case of interest\nwhen doing one-loop calculations) numerous approaches have been employed to\ndetermine this expansion to very high order; when $x \\neq y$ (relevant for\ndoing calculations beyond one-loop) there appear to be but two examples of\nperforming the DeWitt expansion. In this paper we compute the off-diagonal\nelements of the DeWitt expansion coefficients using the Fock-Schwinger gauge.\nOur technique is based on representing $M_{xy}$ by a quantum mechanical path\nintegral. We also generalize our method to the case of curved space, allowing\nus to determine the DeWitt expansion of $\\tilde M_{xy} = \\langle x| \\exp\n\\case{1}{2} [\\case{1}{\\sqrt {g}} (\\partial_\\mu - i\nA_\\mu)g^{\\mu\\nu}{\\sqrt{g}}(\\partial_\\nu - i A_\\nu) ] t| y \\rangle$ by use of\nnormal coordinates. By comparison with results for the DeWitt expansion of this\nmatrix element obtained by the iterative solution of the diffusion equation,\nthe relative merit of different approaches to the representation of $\\tilde\nM_{xy}$ as a quantum mechanical path integral can be assessed. Furthermore, the\nexact dependence of $\\tilde M_{xy}$ on some geometric scalars can be\ndetermined.
