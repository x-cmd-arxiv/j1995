As far as we\nknow, this is the first detection of toroidal correction terms in a real star.\nThe two modes probably are the result of rotational splitting.\n  Our analysis provides for the first time a physical explanation of certain\ncharacteristics of the observed behavior of the star. The amplitude of the\nradial part of the pulsation for $f_1 = 0.795$\\,d$^{-1}$ is a factor of 4\nlarger than the one for $f_2 = 0.346$\\,d$^{-1}$. Since the photometric\nvariability is determined mostly by temperature variations, which in turn are\ndetermined by the radial part of the pulsation, the photometric variability is\ndominated by the mode with frequency $f_1$.

The connection is two-fold: First, as already known, the proper\ntime equation is the product of the Zamolodchikov metric and the\nrenormalization group beta function. Second, the condition that the two-point\nfunction is the Zamolodchikov metric, implies the proper time equation. We\nstudy the massless vector of the open string in detail. In the exactly\ncalculable case of a uniform electromgnetic field strength we recover the\nBorn-Infeld equation. We describe the systematics of the perturbative\nevaluation of the gauge invariant proper time equation for the massless vector\nfield. The method is valid for non-uniform fields and gives results that are\nexact to all orders in derivatives. As a non trivial check, we show that in the\nlimit of uniform fields it reproduces the lowest order Born-Infeld equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 1995 15:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 1995 00:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
