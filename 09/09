We examine the\nbehavior of the spectrum, and find that there is a maximal value for the\nmagnetic field $H_{\\rm max}\\sim M_{\\rm Plank}^2$. At this value all states that\ncouple to the magnetic field become infinitely massive and decouple. We also\nfind tachyonic instabilities for strong background fields of the order ${\\cal\nO}(\\mu M_{\\rm Plank})$ where $\\mu$ is the mass gap of the theory. Unlike the\nfield theory case, we find that such ground states become stable again for\nmagnetic fields of the order ${\\cal O}(M^2_{\\rm Plank})$. The implications of\nthese results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 1995 16:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
