Novel QCD features of the production of excited states and of the\nrestoration of flavor symmetry are analyzed. At the onset of the asymptotic\nregime, our analysis finds an important role of quark Fermi motion within the\ndiffractively produced vector mesons, and we suggest to use this effect to\nmeasure the high momentum tail of the wave function of the vector mesons. We\ndeduce a kinematical boundary for the region of applicability of the\ndecomposition of the hard amplitudes over powers of $Q^2$ and/or a limit on the\nincrease of the cross sections of hard processes at small $x$, and briefly\nanalyze its consequences.
