The model is based on the primitive equations including\nthe moist process, and two kinds of coordinates are used: the spherical\ncoordinate and the Cartesian coordinate with a uniform rotation. The surface\ntemperature is externally fixed and the troposphere is cooled by the radiation;\nunstable stratification generates large-scale convective motions.\n  Dependencies on the surface temperature difference from north to south Delta\nT_s are investigated. The numerical results show that a systematic multi-cell\nstructure exists in every experiment. If the surface temperature is constant\n(Delta T_s = 0 ), convective motions are organized in the scale of the Rossby\ndeformation radius and their precipitation patterns have a periodicity of the\nadvective time tau_D. As Delta T_s becomes larger, the organized convective\nsystem tends to propagate toward warmer regions. The convective cells\ncalculated in the Cartesian coordinate model is very similar to those of the\nmid-latitudes in the spherical coordinate model. In particular, the Hadley cell\ncan be regarded as the limit of the convective cells in the equatorial\nlatitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 1995 06:56:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 1995 09:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Previous\nstudies have shown that fitting the spectra with the standard, optically thick\nand geometrically thin accretion disk models often led to luminosities which\ncontradict the basic assumptions adopted in the standard model. There is no\nknown reason why the accretion rates in AGN should not be larger than the thin\ndisk limit. In fact, more general, slim accretion disk models are\nself-consistent even for moderately super-Eddington luminosities. We calculate\nhere spectra from a set of thin and slim, optically thick accretion disks. We\ndiscuss the differences between the thin and slim disk models, stressing the\nimplications of these differences for the interpretation of the observed\nproperties of AGN. We found that the spectra can be fitted not only by models\nwith a high mass and a low accretion rate (as in the case of thin disk fitting)\nbut also by models with a low mass and a high accretion rate. In the first case\nfitting the observed spectra in various redshift categories gives black hole\nmasses around 10^9 solar masses for a wide range of redshifts, and for\naccretion rates ranging from 0.4 to 8 solar masses/year. In the second case the\naccretion rate is around 10^2 solar masses/year for all AGN and the mass ranges\nfrom 3*10^6 to 10^8 solar masses. Unlike the disks with a low accretion rate,\nthe spectra of the high-accretion-rate disks extend into the soft X-rays. A\ncomparison with observations shows that such disks could produce the soft X-ray\nexcesses claimed in some AGNs. We show also that the sequence of our models\nwith fixed mass and different accretion rates can explain the time evolution of\nthe observed spectra in Fairall 9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 1995 13:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We derive our results on a\ngeneral, abstract level having in mind as a main application potentials of the\nYang--Mills type and in various dimensions. We present a new and powerful\nmethod for proving existence of $\\hat S$ which is also applicable to other\nsituations like external gravitational fields. We also give two complementary\nderivations of the change of phase of the scattering matrix under generalized\ngauge transformations which can be used whenever our method of proving\nexistence of $\\hat S$ applies. The first is based on a causality argument i.e.\\\n$\\hat S$ (including phase) is determined from a time evolution, and the second\nexploits the geometry of certain infinite-dimensional group extensions\nassociated with the second quantization of 1-particle operators. As a special\ncase we obtain a Hamiltonian derivation of the the axial Fermion-Yang-Mills\nanomaly and the Schwinger terms related to it via the descent equations, which\nis on the same footing and traces them back to a common root.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 1995 14:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We use the Hamiltonian formalism in the gauge $\\partial_- A^+ = 0$.\nWhat survives is the dynamical zero mode of $A^+$, which in other theories\ngives topological structure and degenerate vacua. With a point-splitting\nregularization designed to preserve symmetry under large gauge transformations,\nan extra $A^+$ dependent term appears in the current $J^+$. This is reminiscent\nof an (unwanted) anomaly. In particular, the gauge invariant charge and the\nsimilarly regulated $P^+$ no longer commute with the Hamiltonian.
