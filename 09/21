For $Z_N$ and $Z_N\\times Z_M$\norbifolds, we give the possible $U(1)$ R-symmetries which determine the mass\nsplitting, and thus, the supersymmetry breaking at the perturbative level. The\nphenomenlogical viability of this mechanism implies some dimension(s) to be as\nlarge as the TeV scale. We explain how the lighter Kaluza-Klein states\nassociated with the extra-dimension(s) have quantum numbers depending on the\nWilson lines used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 1995 15:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

The nuclei are disposed in a\nCoulomb lattice, and it is believed that the structure of the lattice\ninfluences considerably the specific heat of the neutronic matter inside the\ncrust of a neutron star. Using a modern meson--exchange potential in the\nframework of a local--density approximation we calculate the neutronic specific\nheat accounting for various shapes of the Coulomb lattice, from spherical to\nnon--spherical nuclear shapes. We find that a realistic nucleon--nucleon\npotential leads to a significant increase in the neutronic specific heat with\nrespect to that obtained assuming a uniform neutron distribution. The increase\nis largest for the non--spherical phase of the crust. These results may have\nconsequences for the thermal history of young neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 1995 08:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
