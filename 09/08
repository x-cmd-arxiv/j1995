Current stellar evolution\nmodels do not match the observed $^7$Li abundance patterns, suggesting that the\ninput physics and/or the assumptions used in constructing the models are in\nneed of revision. It appears that all halo stars have suffered some $^7$Li\ndepletion, implying that the primordial $^7$Li abundance is higher than that\npresently observed in hot halo stars. Observations of abundances of various\nelements in globular cluster giant branch stars have suggested for some time\nnow that some form of deep mixing, which is not present in theoretical models,\noccurs in halo stars. The driving mechanism for this mixing, and its\nincorporation into stellar models remain one of the key problems in stellar\nmodeling. Current theoretical isochrones are able to provide a good match to\nobserved colour-magnitude diagrams. However, there is some evidence that the\ntheoretical luminosity functions are in disagreement with observations. This is\nan area which requires further study, as it suggests that the relative main\nsequence/giant branch lifetimes predicted by the models are incorrect. A\ndiscussion of some of the uncertainties involved in determining the ages of\nglobular clusters is presented. The absolute ages of globular clusters provide\na lower bound to the age of the universe, and so are of great interest to\ncosmologists.

Its explicit form is obtained and is shown to have a similar\nstructure as in the N=0 case. Both $N=0 W\\hat A(n-1)^{(1)}$ and $N=2 W\\hat\nA(n-1| n-1)^{(1)}$ Miura transformations involve $(n-1) N=0$ and N=2 conserved\ncurrents with integer conformal spins. The leading cases are discussed. Using\nthe U(1) charge of the N=2 algebra, we develop also a new method of\nconstructing N=2 superfield realizations of the N=2 higher spin supercurrents.\nAmong other results, we find that in general there are three series of $(n-1)$\nhigher conformal spin N=2 supercurrents. The usual N=2 super $W$ currents are\nthe only hermitian ones. At the $n=3$ level, we find a new Feigin Fuchs type\nextension of the conformal spin one N=2 supercurrent. Such a feature, which has\nno analogue at the $n=2$ level, is also present for $n>3$. Finally, we give the\nN=2 superfield formulation of the N=2 Boussinesq equation and its\ngeneralization involving complex N=2 supercurrents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 1995 10:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
