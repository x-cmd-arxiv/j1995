There exists a pairwise orthogonal family F of size continuum such\nthat F is a subset of l_p for every p>2.\n  It was already known that there exists a family of continuum many pairwise\northogonal elements of real sequences.\n  Thm 2. There exists a perfect maximal orthogonal family of elements of real\nsequences.\n  Abian raised the question of what are the possible cardinalities of maximal\northogonal families.\n  Thm 3. In the Cohen real model there is a maximal orthogonal set cardinality\nomega_1, but there is no maximal orthogonal set of cardinality k with \\omega_1<\nk < c.\n  Thm 4. For any countable standard model M of ZFC and cardinal k in M such\nthat M satisfies k^\\omega=k, there exists a ccc generic extension M[G] such\nthat the continuum of M[G] is k and in M[G] for every infinite cardinal i less\nthan or equal to k there is a maximal orthogonal family of cardinality i.\n  Thm 5. (MA_k(\\sigma-centered)) Suppose cardinality of X is less than or equal\nto k, X contains only finitely many elements of l_2, and for every distinct\npair x,y in X the inner product (x,y) converges. Then there exists a z such\nthat z is orthogonal to every element of X.\n  Thm 6.(a) There exists X which is a maximal orthogonal family in l_2 such\nthat for all n with 1\\leq n \\leq\\omega there exists Y of cardinality n with (X\nunion Y) a maximal orthogonal family in $\\rr^\\om$. Furthermore, every maximal\northogonal family containing $X$ is countable. (b) There exists a perfect\nmaximal orthogonal family P such that (P intersect l_2) is a maximal orthogonal\nfamily in $l_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

These\nproperties generalize classical ones of Rothberger, Menger, Hurewicz, and\nGerlits-Nagy. In particular, we show that most of the properties introduced in\nPart I are indeed distinct. We characterize two of the new properties by\nshowing that they are equivalent to saying all finite powers have one of the\nclassical properties above (Hurewicz property in one case and in the Menger\nproperty in other). We consider for each property the smallest cardinality of\nmetric space which fails to have that property. In each case this cardinal\nturns out to equal another well-known cardinal less than the continuum. We also\ndisprove (in ZFC) a conjecture of Hurewicz which is analogous to the Borel\nconjecture. Finally, we answer several questions from Part I concerning\npartition properties of covers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 1995 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
