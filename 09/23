From the phase transition points to the Coulomb branch, we find the\nexact Abelian gauge couplings, $\\tau$, for arbitrary bare masses and Yukawa\ncouplings. We thus {\\em derive} the result that $\\tau$ is a section of an\n$SL(2,\\Z)$ bundle over the moduli space and over the parameters space of bare\nmasses and Yukawa couplings. For $N_c>2$, we derive the exact effective\nsuperpotential in branches of supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories with one\nsupermultiplet in the adjoint representation ($N_A=1$) and zero or one flavor\n($N_f=0,1$). We find the quantum vacua of these theories; the equations of\nmotion can be reorganized into the singularity conditions of a genus $N_c-1$\nhyperelliptic curve. Finally, we present the effective superpotential in the\n$N_A$, $N_f<N_c$ cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 1995 14:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
