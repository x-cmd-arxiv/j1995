A spatially integrated ($7.8''$\ndiameter aperture) measurement of the degree of polarization of the $V-$band\n(rest frame 0.19 $\\mu$m) emission yields a value of 16.4\\% ($\\pm 2.2$\\%) with a\nposition angle of $42{}\\rlap{\\rm .}^\\circ 4$ ($\\pm 3{}\\rlap{\\rm .}^\\circ 9$),\northogonal to the position angle on the sky of the major axis of the extended\nemission. The peak emission measured with a $3.6''$ diameter circular aperture\nis 11.7\\% ($\\pm 1.5$\\%) polarized with a position angle of $42{}\\rlap{\\rm\n.}^\\circ 4$ ($\\pm 3{}\\rlap{\\rm .}^\\circ 6$). An image of the polarized flux is\npresented, clearly displaying that the polarized flux is extended and present\nover the entire extent of the object. While it has been suggested that the UV\ncontinuum of 3C~256 might be due to star formation (Elston 1988) or a\nprotogalaxy (Eisenhardt \\& Dickinson 1993) based on its extremely blue spectral\nenergy distribution and similar morphology at UV and visible wavelengths, we\nare unable to reconcile the observed high degree of polarization with such a\nmodel. While the detection of polarized emission from HZRGs has been shown to\nbe a common phenomena, 3C~256 is only the third object for which a measurement\nof the extended polarized UV emission has been presented. These data lend\nadditional support to the suggestion first made by di Serego Alighieri and\ncollaborators that the ``alignment effect'', the tendency for the extended UV\ncontinuum radiation and line emission from HZRGs to be aligned with the major\naxis of the extended radio emission, is in large part due to scattering of\nanisotropic nuclear emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 1995 18:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

From modelling these lines, the mass of a\nwhite dwarf can, in principle, be determined accurately, thus leading to\nconstraints on the evolution of the binary and the mass of the neutron star.\nOur present spectrum is not of sufficient quality to set a strong limit, but it\ndoes indicate that the white dwarf most likely has a low mass.

From similar\nconsiderations, the companion of PSR 0655+64 is expected to be a more massive,\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf. This is confirmed by our spectra, which show the\nSwan bands of molecular carbon, making it a DQ star. Unlike what is observed in\nother DQ stars, the strength of the Swan C2 bands changes drastically, by a\nfactor two in about two hours. We suggests this reflects large-scale surface\ninhomogeneities which are rotated in and out of the observed hemisphere.

The interaction with the medium is assumed to\ndepend on the relative distances between the quarks in the nucleon consistent\nwith the notion of color neutrality, and to be proportional to the nucleon\ndensity. In the resulting description the nucleon in matter is a superposition\nof the ground state (free nucleon) and radial excitations. The effects of the\nnuclear medium on the electromagnetic and weak nucleon form factors, and the\nnucleon structure function are computed using a light-front constituent quark\nmodel. Further experimental consequences are examined by considering the\nelectromagnetic nuclear response functions. The effects of color neutrality\nsupply small but significant corrections to predictions of observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 1995 20:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Physically, the meson-pair vertices are\nmeant to describe in an effective way (part of) the effects of heavy-meson\nexchange and meson-nucleon resonances. {}From the point of view of ``duality,''\nthese two kinds of contribution are roughly equivalent. The various\npossibilities for meson pairs coupling to the nucleon are inspired by the\nchiral-invariant phenomenological Lagrangians that have appeared in the\nliterature. The coupling constants are fixed using the linear $\\sigma$ model.\nWe show that the inclusion of these two-meson exchanges gives a significant\nimprovement over a potential model including only the standard one-boson\nexchanges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 1995 21:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 1996 23:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
