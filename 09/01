We scrutinize this hypothesis in\norder to determine whether such a model can account for the observed\nwavelength- dependent number counts as well as redshift, color and size\ndistributions. Low-mass galaxies generically arise in large numbers in\nhierarchical clustering scenarios. Although expected to form at high redshifts,\nthe metagalactic UV radiation at high redshifts will delay significant star\nformation (SF) activity in these galaxies until z < 1. We combine these two\nelements, along with simple assumptions about SF histories and efficiency, to\nconstruct our bursting dwarf model. We further augment the model with a\nphenomenological prescription for the formation and evolution of the locally\nobserved galaxies, and use spectral synthesis/Monte-Carlo methods to generate\nrealistic galaxy catalogs for comparison with observations. For reasonable\nchoices of SF histories for the low-mass galaxies, the model results are in\nvery good agreement with the results of the deep galaxy surveys. Moreover, the\nresults of deep HST imaging studies, of gravitational lensing and galaxy\nclustering studies, and of regular galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts\nfavor the dwarf-dominated model.

The t-matrix for the elementary exchange process is\nconstructed in the DWBA, using one pion- plus rho-exchange potential for the\nspin-isospin nucleon- nucleon potential.
