The structure is\nconsistently connected to the hydrostatic stellar interior and provides an\nadequate description of the outer boundary conditions for stellar models with\nlarge mass loss rates. We apply our treatment to evolutionary models of\nWolf-Rayet (WR) stars in order to study the possible influence of the stellar\nwinds on the interior, and to determine more reliable radii of WR stars. The\ninterior structure and evolution of WR stars is found to be unaffected by the\nouter layers.

For WNE and WC/WO stars we also derive subphotospheric radii\ncorresponding to Rosseland optical depths of ~ 10-20.
