We find two asymptotic time regimes: (i)\nstationary dynamics, (ii) slow aging dynamics with violation of equilibrium\ntheorems. We obtain an analytical solution valid for all large times with\nuniversal scalings of two-time quantities with space. A non-analytic scaling\nfunction crosses over to ultrametricity when the correlations become\nlong-range. We propose procedures to test numerically or experimentally the\nextent to which this scenario holds for a given system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 1995 18:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
