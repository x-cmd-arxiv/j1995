However, if a flare is heated by a highly\nfilamented beam directed along the field, then the array of heated cells in a\ncross-section of the flare will result in both small spatial scales (with\nconsequently large temperature gradients) and a large surface area for the\nheated volume, providing a geometrical enhancement of the total cross-field\nenergy flux. To investigate the importance of this filamentary geometry, we\npresent a simple model of a single heated filament surrounded by an optically\nthin radiating shell, obtain an analytical expression for the stable\nequilibrium temperature profile within the shell, and use this to impose limits\non the size of filament for which this model is appropriate.\n  We find that this mechanism by itself is capable of transporting a power of\nthe same order as a large flare, with a moderate range of filament sizes. The\nlength scales are substantially smaller than can be resolved at present,\nalthough they should be regarded as underestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 1995 18:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
