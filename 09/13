A\nsubsequent lengthy, milder, star formation phase with a normal IMF ensues,\nresponsible supposedly for the stellar population observed today. Based upon\nchemical evolution arguments alone, this scenario has been invoked to explain\nthe observed metal mass, and their abundance ratios, in the intracluster medium\nof galaxy clusters. Building upon the recent compilations of\nmetallicity-dependent isochrones for simple stellar populations, we have\nconstructed a coupled photometric and chemical evolution package for composite\nstellar populations in order to quantify the effects of such a model upon the\nphoto-chemical properties of the resultant elliptical galaxies.

Accretion occurs due to the\noverflow of the effective potential barrier near the black hole, similar to the\ncase of the Roche lobe overflowing star in a binary system.
