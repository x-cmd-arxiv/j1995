In this region, the phase space structure\nnear orbital resonances with Neptune is of special interest for the long term\nstability of orbits. There is reason to believe that a significant fraction\n(perhaps most) of the Kuiper Belt objects reside preferentially in these\nresonance locations. This paper describes the dynamics of small objects near\nthe major orbital resonances with Neptune. Estimates of the widths of stable\nresonance zones as well as the properties of resonant orbits are obtained from\nthe circular, planar restricted three-body model. Although this model does not\ncontain the full complexity of the long term orbital dynamics of Kuiper Belt\nobjects subject to the full N-body perturbations of all the planets, it does\nprovide a baseline for the phase space structure and properties of resonant\norbits in the trans-Neptunian Solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 1995 19:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
