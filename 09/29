However, when this\ncondition is not satisfied, the difference between the classical formula and\nthe exact result can be quite large, and even periastron recession can result.\nThe largest difference arises when one of the low order modes of the star is\nnearly resonant with an integer multiple of the orbital frequency minus twice\nthe rotation rate of the star.
