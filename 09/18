We\nconsider the vertical structure of such a corona and show that the radial\ninfall is accompanied by strong vertical outflow. Such a model has two\nimportant consequences: (i) at a given radius the corona forms only for\naccretion rate larger than a limiting value and the fraction of energy\ndissipated in the corona decreases with increasing accretion rate, and (ii) the\ndisc spectra are significantly softer in the optical/UV band in comparison with\nthe predictions of standard accretion discs due to the mass loss and the\ndecrease of internal dissipation in the disc.

Coalescence is prevented by an energy barrier for a topological\nring defect formation in a neck between the two merging droplets. There is a\ncharacteristic size of emulsion droplets, typically tens of microns or more,\ncontrolled by the balance of elastic and anchoring energies of the liquid\ncrystal. On removal of liquid crystallinity (by raising the temperature above\n$T_{ni}$ in thermotropic nematic materials, for example) the energy barriers\nfor coalescence disappear and emulsion droplets can merge quickly, controlled\nonly by the traditional kinetic effects. Practical applications of this effect,\nas well as some wider theoretical implications are discussed in the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 1995 14:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

To a good\napproximation, the continuum can be replaced by a small set of\noptimally-determined resonance states, suggesting that in many nuclei far from\nstability it may be possible to incorporate continuum effects within\ntraditional shell-model based approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 1995 13:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

The time evolution of these states is studied\nfor orbits with different semimajor axes and eccentricities. The elliptical\nsqueezed states may be useful for a description of the motion of Rydberg wave\npackets excited by short-pulsed lasers in the presence of external fields,\nwhich experiments are attempting to produce.
