We show that, in\neach case, the main result obtained for the final lepton channel can be\ngeneralized, so that every experimentally measurable quantity can be expressed\nin terms of input parameters \\underline{measured} on Z resonance, of\n$\\alpha(0)$ and of a small number of subtracted one loop expressions. Some\nexamples of models are considered for several c.m. energy values, showing that\nremarkable simplifications are often introduced by our approach. In particular,\nfor the case of a dimension-six lagrangian with anomalous gauge couplings, the\nsame reduced number of parameters that would affect the observables of final\nleptonic states are essentially retained when one moves to final hadronic\nstates. This leads to great simplifications in the elaboration of constraints\nand, as a gratifying byproduct, to the possibility of making the signal from\nthese models clearly distinguishable from those from other (both universal and\nnon universal) competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 1995 11:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 1995 13:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 1995 15:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
