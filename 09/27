The coefficient of the Dirac function is a linear\ncombination of the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature) of the\njunction. Thus, unless the junction has vanishing extrinsic curvature, the\nphysical interpretation of the metric is that it describes a layer of matter\n(with stresses but no energy or momentum) at the junction. In particular, such\nmetrics do not satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations, nor the\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon equations and so on. Similarly, the d'Alembertian of a\nKlein-Gordon field contains the Dirac function with coefficient given by the\nmomentum of the field.
