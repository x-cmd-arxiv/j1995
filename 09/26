Our major results include: (1) the supernova rate is\nmuch higher in the early phase of evolution of galaxies and there appears a\nhump in the SRN spectrum in the low-energy region of $\\ltilde 5$ MeV, (2) the\nSRN flux depends on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) in a way approximately\nproportional to $H_0^2$ and only weakly on the density parameter of the\nuniverse ($\\Omega_0$) and a cosmological constant ($\\lambda_0$), and (3) the\nplausible event rate at the SK is 1.2 yr$^{-1}$ in the observable energy range.\nSuch a low event rate is due mainly to a quite low supernova rate at present\nwhich is averaged over the morphological types of galaxies.

For general\nfourth-order theories, described by actions which are general functions of the\nscalar curvature, the Ricci tensor and the full Riemann tensor, it is shown\nthat the higher-derivative theories may have multiple stable vacua.
