As one\nspecific example, the accretion of satellite galaxies similar to the present\nretinue of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) would provide an observable metal-poor,\nintermediate-age population. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of\nany contribution made by such stars to the stellar halo. The bulk of the\nstellar populations in the halo show a well-defined turn-off, at B-V ~ 0.4,\nimplying that the vast majority of the stars are old. The fraction of stars\nwhich lie blueward of this well-defined turn-off, with metallicities similar to\nthat of the present dSphs, is used in this paper to place limits on the\nimportance of the recent accretion of such systems. Very few (< ~ 10%) stars\nare found to be bluer (and by implication, younger) than this limit, with the\nhighest value found for the more metal-rich halo ([Fe/H] >~ -1.5 dex). Direct\ncomparison of this statistic with the colour distribution of the turnoff stars\nin the Carina dwarf allows us to derive an upper limit on the number of mergers\nof such satellite galaxies into the halo of the Milky Way. This upper limit is\n~ 40 Carina-like galaxies. The higher metallicity data constrain satellite\ngalaxies like the Fornax dwarf; only <~ 5 of these could have been accreted\nwithin the last < ~ 10 Gyr.
