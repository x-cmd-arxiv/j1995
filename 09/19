The observations involved both searching images for\npoint sources of continuum emission and a time series analysis. Our mean flux\nsensitivity to pulsars slower than 50 ms was 0.2 mJy. No new pulsars were found\nin the survey. The size of the survey, combined with the high sensitivity of\nthe observations, sets a significant constraint on the probability, $f_p$, of a\nrunaway OB star having an observable pulsar companion. We find $f_p \\le 6.5$\\%\nwith 95\\% confidence, if the general pulsar luminosity function is applicable\nto OB star pulsar companions. If a pulsar beaming fraction of \\onethird\\ is\nassumed, then we estimate that fewer than 20\\% of runaway OB stars have neutron\nstar companions, unless pulsed radio emission is frequently obscured by the OB\nstellar wind. Our result is consistent with the dynamical (or cluster) ejection\nmodel for the formation of OB runaways. The supernova ejection model is not\nruled out, but is constrained by these observations to allow only a small\nbinary survival fraction, which may be accommodated if neutron stars acquire\nsignificant natal kicks. According to Leonard, Hills and Dewey (1994), a 20\\%\nsurvival fraction corresponds to a 3-d kick velocity of 420 km s$^{-1}$. This\nvalue is in close agreement with recent revisions of the pulsar velocity\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 1995 19:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

After a generalization of the\nformalism of q-deformed gauge theory to the case of root of unity, we compute\nexplicitely the correlation functions associated to Wilson loops (and more\ngenerally to graphs) on a surface with punctures, which are the interesting\nquantity in the study of moduli space.
